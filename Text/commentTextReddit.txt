Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AskReddit) if you have any questions or concerns.*I'm diagnosed schizoaffective. It started with a bipolar diagnosis when I was a teenager, so I knew I wasn't all there to begin with. I went off my meds for a few years and had pretty mild symptoms. I was going to school and doing well.

In my junior year of college I started getting paranoia pretty badly. It started off mild enough, I think I've always been a little paranoid. It got progressively worse over the course of a couple months and got to the point where I constantly thought I was being followed or on the verge of being physically attacked.

Then I started seeing things. Just little things at first. Bugs crawling on the wall or flying around in the corner of my eye. I would think I saw people and then I'd focus on them and there would be nothing there. Mostly standing on sidewalks while I was driving, which was fun.

It crept up on me to where I didn't think a whole lot about it at first. Maybe a little "that's odd" or thinking something was unusual. Then I kinda took a step back and realized, "Hey. That's not right. I'm freaked out all the time and constantly feel like I'm being hunted down. Maybe I should go back to the doctor."

And now I've been medicated for a couple years. It keeps creeping back up little by little and we just kinda throw more meds at it. I'm pretty functional and as far as I know only a select few know about it, except all of reddit.I'm on medication for schizoaffective disorder and it's helped tremendously. However.

Before I was diagnosed I spent most days in fear of being alone in my home (even though I would isolate myself to my bedroom) because of the visual hallucinations. Some of them were in my peripheral vision, but I used to see hands snaking over the backs of furniture, like couches or beds. It would terrify me. Also, as soon as I would begin to relax, especially before bed, I would hear voices and deep, loud growls. Once I had a friend staying with me and she didn't respond to it and I realized that maybe something was wrong. It took 3 years after that for me to seek medical attention. I would think I was getting better because it would stop, just to return a few days or weeks later.

*edited for spelling and added a word I had an early onset of symptoms, at the age of 12. I was stressed out for different reasons and lived with only my mum, who also has schizophrenia. It skewed my baseline a bit. 

I don't remember the exact first thing that changed, but there were milder early signs. If I stepped on the pavement in this particular pattern, my mum would get better. I walked very strangely as a result, turned around one afternoon and a group of boys from school were laughing at me. I could sense that someone was in the room with me, sometimes. I'd turn on the television, and somebody would say something on the sitcom that matched up exactly with what I was thinking, like we were having a conversation. I'd open a book and there would be a very specific message that seemed like too much of a coincidence. Hallucinations in schizophrenia are usually auditory, but all of mine have tactile and visual. I found lots of tiny pieces of paper stuck on my bedroom wall and when I drew closer to read them, they'd divide by 2. When I went even closer, they'd divide by 2 again. So I could never read what was written on them. I ended up as an involuntary inpatient at a children's psychiatric ward when I was 14, which exacerbated the symptoms further. 

I read a paper in my psychology minor where a group of researchers asked for childhood home videos of people who would later be diagnosed with schizophrenia. It was a blinded study, and researchers found that they could pick which child would grow up to be diagnosed with psychosis based on their motor patterns. The children tended to be clumsier and walk in a stereotypical fashion. Not surprising since the motor system is neurological. The gut system (enteric nervous system) is also neurological, and has been implicated in schizophrenia and more commonly developmental disorders like autism. It's kind of interesting, because it's believed that the first signs of schizophrenia aren't positive symptoms (hallucinations, delusions), but negative symptoms like withdrawal, anhedonia (feeling flat), social interaction issues. So perhaps there's a step even before that. 

I'm in med school now and a bit nervous about my psychiatry rotation actually, because I know patients in the public system aren't always treated with dignity. Fortunately my cohort of students and the staff in my hospital placement are absolutely wonderful people who I trust will treat patients with respect. I was in college, so much stress and anxiety was the cause of it. I began first seeing shadow people. Some passing by on a whim. I can clearly remember one that look like it was wearing a dress, going so quickly down the hall but w it came voices. Jumbled gibberish w high notes of laughter. Then came the name whispers. I got on medication soon after. During this time my anxiety wouldn't let up. 

Also saw many things as a child too. The space under my bed began talking to me in my dreams, then not in my dreams. The first thing I ever remember it saying was "don't worry I'm not going to kill your mom". I was 8 or 9 years old.I don’t hear voices - just noises and sounds. Like the faucet running, window taps, footsteps, doors closing. There’s always a television on.

I think the first kind of event I guess was when I was 20 living with a roommate. I’d been hearing a radio playing loud music outside in the middle of the night. It had been playing for an hour or two and I snapped. Jumped out of bed and tore through the house to get outside and ask them to turn it down.
There was no radio and when I opened the door everything was quiet. Roomie was upset that I woke her up.

Though before that I’d see shadow people when I drove. They’d be jaywalking across the street. Ladies holding children’s hands, men pushing a shopping cart.

That and the stupid cameras. Always assume a room has a camera. In the vents usually. There is always someone watching.My first symptoms were visual and auditory illusions, specifically speech, I didn't hear anything else at the start. I found out something is up when during a conversation with my friends. A person just randomly joined in the conversation, and since no one acted I thought I was the only one who didn't know the person and rolled with it. A bit later my friends asked me who I am speaking to, concerned. I pointed to the newcomer, and he gave a little wave back. Of course, I was the only one who "saw" him. Ironically at the time I thought everyone but me was crazy. After being diagnosed with schizophrenia the guy accepted himself as a part of my imagination. Or technically I imagined a guy who accepted himself as my imagination. Psychology dealing with schizophrenia is mind boggling. I wasn't social because voices told me people were plotting against me. After being in enough situations where I was forced to be social I noticed that a lot of people were actually pretty nice and the ones who weren't didn't care enough about me to do anything.

Once I realized that was a lie I started looking for other things to be suspicious about. I'm in a much better place now.

**EDIT:** I'm getting a lot of questions which is totally fine! I'm happy to answer them. Here's are some answers to the most common responses I'm getting:

* The voices are not internal. They're an audible voice.
* The voices are not my own voice or the voice of anyone I know. They're unique.
* Not all the voices are bad. Now that I'm in a place where the bad ones don't affect me as much there are some nice ones, too.
* The voices don't have a set volume. I don't hear voices as often now and when I do it tends to be muffled, like when you butt dial someone and they're trying to get your attention from your pocket. But they can range anywhere from a whisper to a shout.
* No, I don't think schizophrenia is a decent movie concept on its own. I'd love to have more schizophrenic representation but "guy has schizophrenia" isn't enough to make a good story. **EDIT:** I should have been more clear on this. I'm not saying movies about schizophrenia are bad. But "schizophrenic" shouldn't be a sole character trait. A Beautiful Mind isn't "man is schizophrenic" as much as "man is schizophrenic and a genius mathematician and a husband and father."

Feel free to continue asking me other questions! I'm waist-deep in homework right now but will get to you as I can.Im not your typical case i was 30 years old when i started to hear voices. I was getting ready for a camping trip with the family when i herd someone say "You are doing it wrong". I was in my garage by myself getting my boat ready, it made my blood run cold. I looked everywhere thinking someone was playing a trick on me but found nobody.

The next 4 months where a living hell at my house. I started seeing people in my house at work even outside. They would just stand in corners or walk by a doorway i was literally freaking out non-stop. I thought it would go away but it didnt.

 I finally told my wife when the voices started telling me to kill my wife and daughter. She was very supportive even went to the doctor appointments with me. After a brief saty in the hospital they got my meds worked out and the voices and people stopped manifesting. From time to time i will hear something or see something and i know its not real i just ignor them and move on with what ever im doing I would not necessarily say use this to diagnose yourself without first talking to a doctor, but this is a visual test that people who have schizophrenia always notice that fools most non-schizophrenic people. I said most, not all, so don’t freak out.

Most people will believe they are looking at a face popping out at them. It’s actually caved in.

**Edit:** Thank you for the gold kind stranger!I'm not sure what the *first* time was, but there are certainly some things that stand out in my mind.


When I was 12-ish, I was terrified of the spiders in my room. My mom thought it was because I was afraid of spiders, but individually, I didn't mind them. However, I strongly believed that the spiders on my ceiling and walls coordinated to do me harm. I pretended to be sick in bed one day because there was a spider directly over my door frame, and one beside my light switch, and I could smell an ambush.


Another time, I was in the shower, and something told me that I was dead, very convincingly. I checked the mirror immediately, because TV has conditioned me to think that dead people don't have reflections, I guess. So I finished up in the shower, and got out, and went out into the living room where my family was. Of course, I wasn't dead, but they didn't really acknowledge me when I walked in the room, so I just kind of accepted that I was dead. I went to bed, and for the whole night I thought that I had died, until morning came around.


Those two anecdotes are kind-of lite-mode, I think. The one thing that has really always been present, is music. I hear music almost 24/7. I didn't even realize it was a weird thing, until I started questioning why other people wore headphones.


Finally, when I was around 17, I really started to get paranoid. Like, ludicrously paranoid. I had a small apartment on the second floor of a building, and I kept the blinds and windows closed 100% of the time. I expected, at any moment, for a grenade to be chucked in. I hated leaving my apartment, because there were so many people. I devised strategies for passing them when meeting on a sidewalk. I checked windows and rooftops for snipers. One time, there were too many people on a bus I was supposed to take, so I ended up walking about 40km instead. At one point, I think I really started to break from reality, actually... because I vividly remember trying to work out where the stones on the path in front of me stopped, and the air began, and not really figuring it out.


Shortly thereafter, I completely broke down and went about rebuilding myself.My mom has this and constantly talks to the FBI and Obama. She also talks to her doctor who tells her not to take her meds. We have had her committed a few times because she would get very angry and disappear for a while day in her car and get lost. She a!so doesn't believe my dad is her husband. I have a recording of her talking about it and it's chilling. 

(Edit)

It’s a really unfortunate and life stealing disease. I could go on for years talking about the different things she has seen and people she talks too. I’m sorry for anyone dealing with this and please keep taking your meds. It does help. 

Just know for anyone reading this that has a friend or relative with this disorder, they believe everything they see and hear. It is as real to them as the air you breathe. Don’t get mad at them try and help them. Thanks. I've been diagnosed as Schizoaffective (Bi-Polar type). Basically means that symptoms of the two disorder present themselves. 

Something wasn't quite right when my memory started to decline. Then my cognition got worse, if that makes sense. I'd start walking somewhere, and halfway there, I'd forget how I'd arrived at my location, or why I was even there. I thought I had stumbled out of a dream.

Then I started giving too much weight to ridiculous thoughts and ideas. Normally humans can dismiss stupid ideas like their thoughts are conspiring with the universe to give people cancer, or that everyone is conspiring against you, but...sometimes it went a little too far.

I didn't see anything explicitly wrong because I was still functioning well enough. I just chalked it up to my over-active imagination. I should have gotten help when I started seeing and hearing things. Shadow people lunging at me, following me...Bugs on my skin. Took a certain episode until I did.

Meds were tremendous help, and now in my life, I am doing very well.

Edit: If anyone is seeking advice from me, please know I'm not a professional, and I only have my personal stories to share. If you are concerned that you might be developing a mental disorder, please tell your family, and then seek out professional advice. Also go visit r/schizophrenia There's already 200+ comments at this point but screw it. When I knew something was wrong it was so brief. After that I was just sucked into the delusions and fear. 

Time was passing strangely and my memories are fuzzy about the worst of it.  I remember realizing I couldn't function at work. I asked my boss if I could leave and walked home ( I didn't live far). I called either my boyfriend at the time or my mom on the way and said something was wrong and I needed help. 

I had been prescribed some anti-anxiety medication shortly before that but it put me into a downward spiral. I was trying to save the world. I wanted to solve major problems like world hunger. Problems I had no business trying to figure out. 

Something had happened with my vision. I have NEVER experienced this before and it was so bizarre. I don't know if it had anything to do with schizophrenia or if it was a side effect of the medication but lights...just regular lights in an office or the sun outside...they were so BRIGHT.  I remember when I finally went into a treatment center to speak with someone I had to squint everywhere I went.  It was painful. Also I remember being asked why I couldn't look at the person who was giving me a questionnaire (it was so bright) so I'm pretty sure that I really did go through that. 

 No one ever explained to me why I went through this. If anyone knows anything about this or has experienced something similar, I'm all ears. 

Anyway...the main parts.  Feeling watched. And for some reason I "knew" where the cameras were. In vents, cracks in walls, old punctures from thumb tacs. Radio, movies and television was tough. I remember being in my car and hearing a voice coming out of my radio talking TO me.  Some voice explaining that they were just checking up on me and that they'd be back later.  It was hard to watch TV and enjoy my shows.

I did get hospitalized when this happened. On the way when I was in the ambulance I thought that I was on my way to become part of a team that was going to save the world. Obama was leading it and picked me. :/ Yeah i know...

What else...    I didn't think my mother was really my mother.  She was chosen to take care of me. And my father (parents had seperated when I was very young) had really only left because he was testing my character and once I was proven a "good person" he would come back into my life with plenty of money I could live off of. That delusion is pretty embarrassing. 

I'm glad there was at least some part of me that said "help" while it was all happening and I was able to get some medication to help. It's the most frightening thing I've ever been through and I feel fortunate that I've been able to gain stability and work and be happy since all that. 
I'm schizotypal. When I was 12, I stopped going to school. I can't really pinpoint what exactly made me stop going other than perhaps an instinct that something wasn't right. I felt uncomfortable all the time, it felt like too much effort to keep up with the social things of school (even though nothing out of the ordinary had happened) and I didn't want to be part of it anymore and became depressed. 
I think the great discomfort and this really deep feeling of not being like everyone else were the first signs. I was a totally normal kid but I just always had this feeling that there was something off about who I was. I remember having paranoid thoughts that I was actually two years older than my parents told me I was, sometimes other people seemed cartoonish and one-dimensional to me, even sometimes questioned if other people were real, and I was genuinely convinced that nobody actually liked me (I had plenty of friends). Sometimes my tongue would feel huge in my mouth, or I would feel like my feet were miles apart even though I could clearly see they were right next to each other. 
But of course as a kid I didn't know that any of these things were abnormal and you don't really tell people either, so it wasn't until I stopped going to school that my parents had any idea that something was wrong.

I went through psychoeducation (not sure if that's the english term though) in the psychiatry a few years back and it was really helpful for me to learn about the typical early signs of psychosis, so I know what to pay attention to and when to slow down.

[removed]I am schizo-affective. It all started with depression, which in hindsight might be the deficit, that people who are schizo develop prior to positive symptoms or hearing things.
I ve always been the quiet boy.
I don't know if my quiet personality let me develop depression or if my depression caused my quietness.

I realized something was wrong early in my childhood, cause I always saw people do things all the time, that I wouldn't have done or said in my wildest dreams. I to this day can not figure out how to live a life you want to live or how to "dream".
It's not that I don't want a happy life with a wife, kids etc. It's just, that I can not ever imagine asking girls out, saying what I think about that selfish, self-centered co-worker I have to sit next to or generally doing anything, that is meaningful to someone else or myself.
But enough with the bragging.

First time I heard voices was in my apartment and it was always whispers of neighbors I heard. At first I wasn't able to understand them. Then I thought I did. They sounded real, because by the loudness of their voices, they could in fact have been my neighbors talking about me. 

But one day I drove alone in the car and still heard voices. I turned off the radio to hear the voices and realized, that there can in fact be no people whispering outside my car, since I was driving all the time.

That's when I realized, I'm not only depressed and a siciophobic, but am completely nuts.

It starts making me even more depressed thinking about, that I have no chance of ever escaping that disease and having to deal with it the rest of my life. [removed]I've had Voices All My Life. And at times in my life have been absolutely terrifying. I wake up many many many times in my life thinking that events have happened when they haven't at all and only sometimes even years later I realize that something that I thought had happened never happened. 
I'm a songwriter and will wake up with songs fully formed not only versus but choruses, rhythms Melodies and everything complete and for a long time I thought my brain was just running a song that I had heard at some point on the radio or whatever but I only after time that I realized that these were originals and I just started catching them.
   Remember waking up one time thinking that I had nervously pulled out all the hair of half of one of my eyebrows and I walked around for a week waiting for the hair to grow back and being just self-conscious about it.. Then only realize that at the end of the week when I took a look in the mirror  I hadn't pulled any out and I must have dreamt it and thought it was real.   [deleted][deleted]Oh, oh yay I can answer this! I noticed something wasn't right probably around 19 years old. Because schizophrenia makes you think your hallucinations are normal, the first time I heard a random voice talking to me I didn't realize it shouldn't be happening or that it wasn't real, I thought there was really a woman talking to me despite the fact there wasn't anyone there, eh. Anyway I still am not sure how much of my major depression and serious unhappiness was due to the abusive relationship I was in, and how much of it was from the schizophrenia but around 19 years old everything hit the fan. I couldn't put up with everything that was happening. I had this disconnected from reality feeling happening and was starting to act strangely like sending cryptic messages to my ex's friends. I was slowly starting to go downhill. There were signs that I didn't realize, like people were telling me I was blacking out and doing strange things like staring out windows for an hour just standing there while a group of people outside look at me like what is she doing...or putting cigarettes out on my bare foot...didn't realize it was happening AT ALL...like when I black out my mind creates an alternate reality that seems totally normal...like when I put the cigarette out on my foot I was thinking about it but I didn't realize I was doing it, I thought I was just walking down the sidewalk. Little stuff like this just kept building and building until I felt I was losing my mind and I had to go see a doctor. He diagnosed me depression and mild psychosis, that diagnosis has changed to schizoaffective with depression which is basically schizophrenia combined with a mood disorder. It really stinks to this type of sick...even medicated I'm not fully normal.Finally something for me to answer. 

I was in the prodrome phase which was early signs. I was constantly going to doctors complaining about suicidal thoughts, anxiety, stomach problems.  

I was always brushed off cause I have a degree and a good job, but I was psychotic. I knew things were off and there was something severely wrong with me but one second i believed in Mental health and the next second the delusions took over and meds where a sham perpetrated by “the man”

Cool fact. I actually predicted my hospitalization here on Reddit. I made a post asking when I should go to the loony bin and sure enough later within the week I was hospitalized for my first time ever.  I used to think I could see people that weren’t there. The girl from the ring used to stand in the corner of my room and point at me while I tried to sleep. That and an old guy that would show up from time to time and wave. I also thought my mother was trying to poison me with her food, so I taught myself to cook (for other reasons as well) to make sure the food was safe. 

I wasn’t diagnosed as schizoaffective until I had my first psychotic break a couple years ago when I thought people were watching me through the television and following me everywhere I went. I still fight with the paranoia on a seemingly daily basis and as such I don’t leave the house for usually more than an hour to go to the gym or twenty minutes to go to the store a few times a week. It doesn’t help that my dad built spy software for the government when we first moved to the us. It makes for a shadowy group of people potentially working for the government following you around asking you very personal questions when you’re sitting at a cafe almost plausible which is just fucking terrible to deal with when you have to question reality all the time. [removed][deleted]At some point when I was young, I read about imaginary friends and was surprised to learn that they usually went away and didn't actually tell you things. I didn't tell my parents until much older and faces started appearing in my windows. I have a family history of schizophrenia so the possibility scares me a bit... I sometimes dream as an entirely different person and occasionally hear noises (screams, explosions, etc.) in half-awake states. In fact, I dream almost constantly when sleeping. It's frustrating because I feel like I never get an "escape" from life. I have no idea if these are indicative of anything, but it does worry me a tad![removed]I spent 30 minutes hovering over my sleeping boyfriend with a pillow. He was a heavy sleeper. I could have killed him. I almost did. I woke him up, sent him home (much to his confusion), spent 10 minutes on hold with my psychiatrists’ nurse (I was already being treated for depression), booked an appointment, hauled ass to the clinic, waited 3 hours to be seen, told him everything, got a script, went straight to pharmacy, got my pills, and took them immediately. I’ve done my absolute best to try and stay medicated properly ever since. Of course I grew up knowing my mother had mental illness, so I was a-typically very educated about the whole thing. Otherwise, he’d likely been dead since 2008.

EDIT: to answer some questions:

This was not after a fight. I just was aware things were coming to an end. The relationship was not meant to be. In the heat of the moment, I had the idea that if I killed him he would die my boyfriend. It’s not logical. I’ve always struggled with homicidal thoughts, but this was the first and so far only time I almost committed homicide. By and large I struggle more with suicidal thoughts, but because my schizophrenia often causes me to become catatonic, I’ve mostly avoided attempts on my life (i.e. my brain performs petrificas totalis when I think of killing myself).[removed]Comment may get buried, but here I go. 

The aliens I was able to see in patterns of furniture, flooring, walls directed me to decipher a code. So I wrote up a notebook of total nonsense and then tried to decipher it. At the back of my mind during this, I was able to see logically that it didn't make sense, but I still had psychosis.[removed]Schizoaffective here... I don’t hear voices but have massive delusions that the world around me is totally construct and I’m actually a homeless person living behind a dumpster or a prostitute in a seedy motel. I also have delusions that if I kill myself and my children I will move on to the next “string of life” and jump ahead or over. It’s hard to explain. I will also drive aimlessly without realizing until I’m miles away from my destination. But my meds work wonders!!! I’m all good right now as long as I don’t resist treatment.When I was younger, I was in the living room at around 5-6 AM, just when the sun was coming up and everything was all blue. I looked down for a second and saw a pale white girl with sunken in eyes staring back at me. It took around 5 seconds of frozen staring for me to blink and for the figure to just be a vacuum cleaner.

A few years later I was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia for some other reasons, for example...

I've been seeing floating orbs and shadow people/animals for a while. Kind of trying to be careful describing it because I don't want to bring them back. If I were to describe them, they're like flowing water, in a way.

Pitch black, slightly see-through and they move in very unnatural ways, the physics are always slightly off. They usually vanish once you look straight at them, but occasionally they've been there for hours and only when I reach out to pet them (thinking they're my actual animals), I realize they were never there. I'm pretty sure most people who have lived in a haunted house have some form of mild psychosis or schizophrenia.[removed][deleted]I kinda always felt "off" or "distant".


When I was eight, I asked to go to therapy because I noticed that my emotions weren't rational.


It's been a strange life ever since.[deleted]I’m diagnosed as Schizoaffective, meaning I experience symptoms of Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder both. I noticed something wasn’t right when I started to think (especially during times i had ingested psychedelics) that people were taking pictures of me (i would see flashes of lights outside the windows) and talking about me behind my back. It just kept getting worse after that one time and it kept spiraling downwards. It went from slightly paranoid thoughts to full blown delusions and ultimately insane beliefs. I started to really withdraw from the people i had called my best friends and hung out with on a daily basis because i was convinced they were plotting against me. I️ think this all just got significantly worse after my last bout with psychedelics. We went camping and had a tent to do our drugs in during the day and night. I️ remember taking 2 tabs of acid and then I️ have no clue whether the 3 water bottles I️ drank were laced with more. I️ thought that while i was in the tent by myself that all of my ‘friends’ were on the outside mocking me and making fun of me all while pushing on the tent. At one point I️ looked outside and saw people walking in lines with big branches in their hands singing “kumbayah” (I️ could not make this shit up). If you’ve ever seen the movie “The Truman Show” that’s exactly what everyday life feels like, as if someone or something is constantly watching you (i would look for hidden cameras everywhere i went for around a 4-6 month period) and you are there for other people to watch you. I’ve had delusions to the point of believing that i was the second coming of Jesus, or just a messiah of sorts. I’ve thought that the Truman Show was a metaphorical documentary for my life(meaning I thought i was like Truman in that my entire life is a TV show and a lie). Imagine if every single person in the world was talking about you at once, people at school, teachers during lectures, reporters on the news, actors in movies and tv shows. That is paranoid schizophrenia/psychosis. I would turn on the TV and think that every single show and movie had euphemisms and hidden messages pertaining to me specifically, messages that they wanted me to know about the “big reveal” where everything would be revealed to me finally. I’ve thought that i had super powers or that I️ have some sort of special purpose in life that I’m being pushed towards. I realized when i started to distrust my closest friends, some of whom I’d known for more than 3/4 of my life, and my girlfriend who sat with me while i bawled and cried for hours about how i was losing my mind, that I had an illness and I needed to get help. 

Sorry for the formatting and wall of text, I’m on mobile. I also just wanted to thank anyone that was willing to take the time to read anything in this entire post, including my comment. For people like us, sometimes it means more than anything in the world just to listen. 

My son is 13 and has schizoaffective disorder. Basically, it's schizophrenia and bipolar all mixed together. Fun, right?! Anyway he hears voices and sees shadows out of the corner of his eye. Earlier this summer, after a bad year of school and all the stress of transitioning from school to summer (he's autistic as well so changes of routine affect him greatly) he has a particularly bad episode where the voices told him to hurt his little sister. This had happened before, she's a pretty big trigger for him, but he was able to resist. This time that didn't happen. Luckily I was there to stop him before things got really bad. As I was watching him and telling him what he was about to do and why that was bad, I could see the moment when the fog cleared and he came back to himself and realized something was really wrong. It was heartbreaking. We ended up having to put him in a psychiatric hospital for a week. Now we're going through different cocktails and with him going through puberty, it is extremely difficult. He's better. For the most part, the voices are gone but they come back when he's having a manic episode. Fortunately at the hospital they taught him and us different coping skills to deal with that when it happens. Hopefully we can get him on the right meds with the least side effects at some point in the near future. But for now, we just keep the lines of communication open between each other and his doctors and deal with stuff as it happens. But I wouldn't wish this on anyone.[removed]I'm schizoaffective depressive type, a kind of schizophrenia. I was being treated for my depression which was pretty severe at the time. Several of the doctors I went through asked me if I was hearing or seeing things they didn't. I said no because I didn't think that the voices in my head were abnormal. I thought everyone had multiple voices in their heads. After being asked that same question like four times I did a little research on it and found out that my voices were not normal at all. I told my doctor about the voices and he changed gave me a low dose of antipsychotics and changed my diagnosis to depression with psychotic features. I was fine (granted I had severe depression and voices in my head telling me terrible things all day) for a while until I started to feel that people were after me. I believed that people wanted to kill me and that I was being indoctrinated into a cult. I told this to my therapist and she became concerned that I might have schizophrenia. To make a long story short, my depression eventually went away for a little bit but my psychosis stayed. Thus I was diagnosed schizoaffective depressive type.I was 12 or 13 and heard someone's voice in my head that was not my own. It was so clear it sounded like someone was in my room telling me I'm not good enough to be alive. I started freaking the fuck out, crying hysterically and ran to my mom and dad to try to get away from it but it kept following me. They tried to calm me down telling me its not real but it sure as fuck was for me. I calmed down and my parents I guess chalked it up to hormones. It progressively got worse to the point of hallucinations and a suicide attempt that I was admitted to a psych hospital and put on medication. I was pretty clued in to what Schizophrenia is and how it effects people. I am a nurse who has always had a keen interest in mental health. 

The first signs were horrible panic attacks and paranoia that people at work were trying to get me fired. I came to believe they were all there working against me. A friend informed me that I was being very paranoid, and I noticed a lot of negative symptoms, fuzzy thinking, inability to remember simple things. I started to hear voices intermittently. I suspected what was coming but when I finally had a psychotic break I still had no insight. I walked into the police station and asked to file a report about aliens mind controlling people at my work. It seemed the only logical explanation to me, it was as though everything finally made sense and that was the truth of the world. 

In short, I knew it was coming but that didn’t stop it. [removed][deleted]As far back as I could remember, there were two voices in my head. They'd keep me company, but sometimes they'd say weird things or be annoying. When I had sleepovers they'd tell me stories and I'd relay them to everyone else (pretending they were my own ideas, which they technically were I guess), and everyone enjoyed them. Since they were only in my head, I'd also only speak to them in my head—that was just how it worked, I didn't question it. When they told me things, they were almost always right, so I believed them without question. Sometimes it was just straight-up paranoia, though, which got me into a lot of trouble on occasion (blaming my brothers for random things, like losing my favorite pencil or tripping and spraining my ankle). I didn't have a strong sense of morality growing up, so if it was suggested that I rip the wings off the fly that was buzzing around, I'd catch it and do that (which also got me in trouble, because my parents believed all life was important and I should've let it go outside).

When I was 13, the issue was exacerbated. Suddenly, there weren't two voices, there were seven. One of them was God. I'd ask Him questions and he'd give me answers. There was a sense of trust in that relationship; he was like a mentor. If I did something wrong, He'd "punish" me (though it wasn't always rational, like if I took the last slice of cake that _was_ for me, without sharing it) by making me feel terribly nauseated, to the point that it was debilitating ("He" also traumatized me from masturbation through the same punishment system). The thing is, that voice was always telling me to do the right thing, not the wrong thing.

Five of the other voices were quiet for the most part, though they were always having conversations in the background. Sometimes they would get so loud that I'd scream in my head for them to shut up so I could think (mostly when they got bored, like when I was working on school assignments). I was terrified I would yell at them in public (I didn't know why, but that just wasn't something people did—at this point I still assumed everyone had other people in their heads). I walked oddly, I know that for sure, and I always had to look down at the ground and make sure I didn't step on any branches, I always stepped where there were the least leaves, no matter what I couldn't step on cracks in pavement, and if there was a series of lines (like at the street crossing), I had to always step on those lines only.

At one point I hallucinated that there was something in a cup I was drinking out of (it was really disgusting but I don't know what it was), and from that point forward, even now, I can't use a dish, glass, or utensil if it has even a speck or a water stain on it.

The seventh voice was that of the Devil, always trying to get me to let him have my soul or my body, or both. I was terrified I'd let up in a moment of weakness, especially when I was around other people, so I was always tense and uneasy. I knew that if he took over, he'd kill everyone around me. It's awful to say this, but I think he was my uninhibited side.

When I was around 14, I started having more physical hallucinations. I'd hear voices or music (the voices in my head would also on occasion play music for me). I saw someone open an employees-only door and leave it open, but when I turned to go tell them, the door was shut. I heard people asking questions through doors, often people I knew, but when I asked who it was I would get no answer (which kind of freaked me out, to be honest; I started thinking there were imitations living around me).

When I was just turning 15, I finally started getting help after the symptoms became _much_ worse. Everyone was out to get me; I hated leaving the house, so much so that I'd argue vehemently against it. I heard people breathing behind me. When I was walking outside, there were always footsteps behind me that were just a bit out of sync from and went on just a bit longer than mine. I started using "incantations" to ward off the Devil and spirits—I would speak gibberish in the bathroom, and sometimes outside. When I looked into a mirror, there were sometimes shapes behind me, and my face would suddenly change into terrifying things. The turning point was when I started seeing a white werewolf in the house (I knew that shouldn't exist, so I started suspecting around then), and at one point when I went to the restroom I suddenly felt it pressed against me, breathing down on my head (it was around 8 feet tall). I couldn't move, I had an utter panic attack and broke down yelling for someone to help. Naturally, there was nothing really there.

I started medication for it after that, and they worked to get rid of most of the physical hallucinations and all of the voices in my head (which was kind of lonely, and I hated that "God" left me). I had a sense that I wasn't "me", though, that I was one of the voices that was in my head before. I acted oddly sometimes, making no sense, and I would get confused about how my body was supposed to move. When I saw characters on TV that, for example, had kidney failure or were blind, I thought to myself, "it'd be so much simpler to be like that". I tried to make both happen, terrible experiences. I'm now terrified something will happen to my eyes, ironically.

At the same time, I had "episodes" of homicidal ideations. They would last for days or weeks, and during the hours or days I was "lucid", I felt terrible. I would remember the detailed plans I made to become a serial killer when I moved out (worse than most serial killers, to be quite honest; among the worst). I trained myself in an undoubtedly toxic form of meditation during that time, one that sealed away my emotions and made my thoughts seem like they weren't mine. It was awkward to move like that, because it was hard to force those thoughts that didn't belong to me into my body. I relapsed occasionally, especially during times when I was happy (which made me hate myself, and the fear of being happy is something I'm still struggling to work through).

I decided I needed help during one of those times, and I told my parents. We went to the psychiatrist again, where I told her I was fine, but fortunately my parents were there to argue against that, knowing how upset I was and that I wasn't lucid again. I started a medication that tanked my memory and emotions. It was terribly hard to think at all, I was like a zombie. I've gradually worked my way off it and I haven't relapsed (likely due to the other medication finally working as it should). I still feel like I'm not the "me" I used to be, though, and I sometimes get the desire to self-mutilate again, often in other ways.

That's my story.[removed]i started becoming more paranoid. everyone was looking at me, everyone was talking shit on me. cool tones were registered as accusatory. it was a nightmare, and completely differerent from what i had felt even a month before. i was brushed off my my psychiatrist as having anxiety. I hear singing voices.  It's actually quite beautiful but can get so annoying as it can sometimes be quite constant.  It's like a choir of people singing.  They just comment on things I'm doing in a sing song way.  
Sometimes it gets to be too much that I have to put headphones on to drown them out.  
I'm on medication for it now which helps to drown out most of it but man, does it give you the munchies.  I have to actively be very aware to not overeat to prevent weight gain.Heard my mom scream blood murder from downstairs. Threw pants on, bolted to the living room to see her seated comfortably on the computer browsing facebook. Asked what was wrong in a panicked tone, she just looks at me like I'm crazy. Turned out I was :) 

A few years "Clean" (no hallucinations or delusions), got some meds lined up that work really well for me, and had some kickass treatment over the years I was figuring shit out. If there’s anyone still reading this thread that has some kind of knowledge or insight on schizophrenia and would want to talk with me, please pm me. I was adopted as a baby but my bio-mom was paranoid schizophrenic and my bio-dad was severely bipolar. I was just recently diagnosed with bipolar II not long ago, but I’ve had symptoms my whole life that sound very similar to the ones I’m reading in this thread and I’ve always been wary of them and concerned that they could be at least tendencies leaning towards this disorder. I’ve talked to my psychiatrist and therapist about them and they don’t think I’m schizophrenic but one therapist/psychiatrist opposed to another may not always give you the correct diagnosis. So, like I said, if anyone has real knowledge on this disorder please feel free to pm me if you’d like to talk further or at least reply to this comment so others can reach out to you if they feel they need to. I was in college and I recounted to a teammate about a person who visited me sometimes and they were trying to kill me - this person floated and looked half dead. It never occurred to me that this was a strange thing but the look of shock I was given was really curious to me. It made me think they must never experience something like that. That was the first time I thought maybe something was up. I was referred to a psychiatrist but I didnt talk about the visitations because I didnt think it was any different then talking about people on my sports team. I also started to notice people mentioning that I never talked. It actually took another five years, and an experience I had when I attempted suicide, for me to realize that my experiences and my emotional state were not experienced by most people and that I needed to get help. I found out far too late. I would be talking to someone and hear something completely different than what they said, however I still heard it in their voice clear as if it was a normal conversation. What they said would line up with my delusional reality. I had no way of knowing what I was experiencing wasn't real. My delusions and paranoia were completely real thanks to audio and visual hallucinations.

After a 3 month episode I was eventually hospitalized and medicated. This is the first time I realized what was going on. I watched recordings of myself and heard the REAL conversations after I stabilized and that was the most painful thing I have ever experienced in life. By the time I started realising that the life I had been living for three months wasn't real I had already lost my job, my fiance, all my savings, and most of my friends. I'm bankrupt, and no longer have insurance to pay for treatment. It was like waking up from a coma finding myself in hell.

I was a successful and happy man, with a bright future ahead of me. I never thought I would ever experience something worse than death, but I honestly did. If it wouldn't hurt my family I would kill myself without hesitation. 

Washed up at 28, I'm haunted every night with nightmares of the life I lost, and the reality that I have this illness is like a bitter poison coating on the dagger that dug into my being.

It destroyed my view of life and the universe. I have to question everything I think and hear. My sentient mind is my prison. I've got a life sentence.

- Hearing voices is very real. It i's not like thinking to yourself.
- I also hear whatever anxieties my mind comes up with. If I'm afraid of a bear in the woods I will hear a bear in the woods.
- visual hallucinations for me are most common on electronic screens.
- the ringing in my ears and skull never stops. I have learned to live with it.
- the most horrendous audio hallucinations I've experienced are hearing my loved ones screaming in agony from being tortured, and hearing an ambulance siren for three days straight. I tried plugging my ears by day three but it did nothing.
- I rarely remembered dreams before my 3 month episode. Maybe one or two a year. Now I remember them every day 
- most of my memories are gone from my psychotic break.
- even on medications I still get mild audio hallucinations, mostly noises like dog barks, high pitched ringing in my ears, or creaking floorboards etc. Otherwise so far I'm as stable as someone could be after experiencing something like this.My parents divorced when I was 5, my mother was just gone one morning. Nobody ever really talked to me about it and I think that was actually really traumatic but I repressed it. I also remember being very depressed and apathetic from maybe age 14-17 or so, but part of that might just come with being a teenager.

Schizophrenia started to set in for me at about 17, but it was pretty gradual. At first I would have these *massive* paranoia attacks out of nowhere, It was like the feeling you get when you know you're being watched without really looking, only multiply that by like 1000. My heart started pounding and I guess it's probably the same as an anxiety or panic attack, but the thing I remember the most is definitely the paranoia.

Then, I thought there were cameras and microphones all throughout my house that my friends had put there to watch and listen to so they could make fun of me, I thought I was telepathic and that people could hear my thoughts and stuff. They also had put some sort of virus on my computer to watch everything on my screen.

After that I started to act on my delusions, I would go on long walks in the snow barefoot, or very very late at night in the country. Eventually a police officer stopped to pick me up, seeing me walking down the road in winter, in new england, without shoes or boots, and I ran. that's how I wound up in a psychiatrists office for the first time.

Then I walked a little too far from my mother's home, and I got lost because I wasn't as familiar with that area and wound up getting picked up by cops again. I was taken to another hospital, they saw I had been to a few hospitals at this point, and then I was involuntarily committed.

From there it was just wave after wave of hellish delusions, my dad was a serial killer, my whole family had died in a fire, my parents and friends were in some sort of cult or something, some of my delusions are kind of too gruesome or violent to talk about but they were pretty much waking nightmares. Thankfully I was in a hospital when things were this bad, as absolutely horrible as those places are. I was stuck there for about 6 months.

It's been about 7 years since things started and I would say I am doing alright. I game, exercise, and I draw a lot. I have my own little place. My symptoms aren't totally gone but they've gone from menacing and nightmarish to helpful, kind little colored lights. Sometimes I'll still hallucinate terrifying things but I'm kind of used to it. 

I've lost all of my friends since things started but I think that also comes with leaving school and everyone going their own way. At this point, I tend to just avoid people, besides my family I don't really have any friends. I really wish people were more accepting, and it's kind of demoralizing whenever someone asks "so what do you do for work?" (I don't,) or when I see my old friends graduating college, getting married and starting families. I try and avoid facebook. Also there have been so, *so,* many fights with family over my living situation and money, and them trying to force me to work when I couldn't. They only made things harder.

Things can get out of control and spiral downward so fast, especially during the first psychotic episode because you are just not prepared for it at all, and your family might not know what to expect or how to handle it either. I wish they had taught me about mental illness and the warning signs in school.

I would say I hadn't really noticed it, it was already too late, and I think that happens to a lot of people.

I also want to add, if you know someone with schizophrenia, just accept them for who they are. Try and see through the illness and realize they are *not that label.* it sucks, it really really sucks when people only see and acknowledge that piece of you as if it's all you are, they will disregard everything you say and really over analyze and pick everything apart, looking at you through a schizophrenia lens.

Sorry if I ramble.

I have been told I have it, then told I don't, then that I do again, then that I don't again, and repeat about 3 times.

6 diffrent Drs over 15 years.

Been prescribes different meds and taken off them a bunch.

So I don't really know if I have it or "A hyperactive subconscious".

I first went to get checked out because when I was a child, I would lashout at the air randomly. I could not concentrate "Because (some name of someone who wasnt there) wouldn't stop calling me stupid/a failure/Boring."I remember hula hooping with my sisters sometime in elementary school. I stepped through the hula hoop and did not step back out. I immediately knew I was in a parallel dimension where everyone looked the same but was a decoy. It was a trap or some kind of illusion. I stepped back through the hula hoop and tried to wave the thought away but it only grew bigger. I also saw vampires and bears at night.


Those memories aren't the first time I noticed "something wasn't right," though. It didn't happen all at once. The discomfort came in waves, rising until it was insurmountable. I accepted the delusions and hallucinations the way I accepted Santa Claus and The Tooth Fairy. This was the world I was given. I did not know so much of my life was made up of symptoms. I didn't know other people didn't see what I did. Ultimately, I accepted it because I thought it was just something everybody lived with and I was just being a wimp. I thought that, and also I often entertained the idea that maybe I was special, that I could see into other dimensions to save people, to save the world like Superman or something, and I had to keep it all a secret, hide everyone from the horrible truth that we were constantly in danger.For me personally, I have partial schizophrenia due to PTSD. It came as an unwarranted side effect of severe trauma for different reason, which is why It was so severe. 

I was around 13 or 14, and sitting in a computer class. It started out as small tv static noises here and there, almost like a loud white noise. Eventually I began hearing whispers behind my ear like someome got a little too close for comfort. I would see a single black shadow that would always engulf a corner of a room in liquid looking black smoke. It didnt really have a form, but it would always have red eyes coming out of it somewhere, followed with the tv static noises. 

I finally said something to my parents one night after waking up to seeing it standing in my room, telling me to burn the house down with my family in it. 

I'm much better now and on meds, so I havent really had problems since.My younger brother has schizophrenia. My older sister has OCD. It makes for an interesting household.   

My little brother was diagnosed similarly to many when he was in college. He tried to hang himself from the light fixture of his dorm. He was probably about 19 years old. Now he goes between periods of what I would call mania where he wants to do ALL THE THINGS and do them immediately, but none of them are realistic. When that's not happening, he's either very low or just muted. He had one job that lasted for a pretty good run, but he was determined the staff was "trying to get rid of him," and he quit. He had another job for literally one day, but they were also trying to get rid of him.   

If you spoke to him in person, there would be no indication he has the life he does. He finds it very disheartening that he didn't go to college and graduate and that he can't keep steady employment. It causes him to cycle between desperately trying to get *any* job, getting it, getting off disability, leaving the job, waiting to get back on disability, and repeat. Been this way for years. I didn't, wasn't until I was medicated out the wazoo when I could actually look back and realize it was all in my head. Any attempt to help from my friends, family, or medical professionals I just viewed as attempts to brainwash me.When I wanted to live in the different perception because it seemed more happy.  I knew the the little girl wasn't real but I want felt like she was my daughter.  I wanted to play and frolic at the park with her.  I wanted to leave reality and just be here and not worry about anything else.  Just want to hear her laugh and play.  I knew it wasn't real but it felt like it.  It was all feelings.  Feelings I couldn't help.  She was there outside my therapists office and I wanted to go fishing with her.  That's all I felt like I wanted.  Her laugh was the greatest sound in the world.  I wanted to hear it continuously.  It was devasting to walk away into my therapists office.  I regret that decision but I know I made the right one. Let me just start by thanking everyone who posted their stories, just reading through a few of these has really helped me come to terms with what im dealing with

About a year ago i was heavily experimenting with LSD, which culminated in me dropping about 400ug all by my lonesome (big mistake). I sat up all night listening to the Beatles and Pink Floyd while watching my 70s popcorn ceiling fractalize into beautiful images, it was like watching a movie screen that reflected the sound of the music i was listening to. At some point during a lull in the music, the fractals all aligned into what looked like a faded picture of a WW1 soldier. I was cast into a void, my room and everything else but the image of the soldier faded away. While this happened my mind was absolutely racing, looking for meaning in what I was seeing. Somehow religion entered my mind, I thought about Jesus' sacrifice, God, heaven, hell, and the like (note i was agnostic at the time). Basically I fell headfirst into a rabbit hole and just kept digging. It felt like i spent an eternity staring at that picture with thoughts passing through my mind faster than I could even process them. I came back to reality with a jerk, and it took a second to fully realize where i was and what was going on. That kind of spooked me so i decided to do something to distract myself. I watched the Cosmos reboot on netflix and let Neil Degrasse Tyson guide me through the rest of the trip. 

The next morning I met up with my parents and my younger brother/sister and basked in the afterglow of the trip, I dont think ive felt happier than that morning before or since. But what goes up must come down I suppose... That same day I started to get the feeling God himself was communicating with me. Note that I wasnt hearing voices, it was more like just a sensation that correlated with my thoughts, the hair on the back of my neck would stand up and id get chills. This kept happening, and it ALWAYS corresponded to my internal monologue, pretty unsettling. As an example, im sitting at red robin with my parents/siblings, im looking at the menu; look at a burger, nothing; look at a salad, chills. Pretty benign so far, so I got the salad. That was the type of "communication" i was dealing with. Unfortunately for me shit went south quick. Next up I think God is telling me to breakup with my girlfriend, so I did... Called her up and dumped her the day before I was gonna drive to her town to see her for a few weeks over Christmas break. I've no doubt thats the biggest mistake ill ever make in my life, after 2 years with her I thought wed spend our lives together, she was/is the girl of my dreams and I threw it all away smh. 

Shit keeps going south... I was driving home when i get another sensation, this time its to die.. just to die. Finally I grew a spine and put up some resistance, but the sensation just kept growing, and I felt like I could straight feel God getting angrier and angrier with me. So i did what any reasonable person would do and floored it. Got up to about 90mph before I steered my car right into a telephone pole. I didnt know this at the time, but somehow my car flipped and rolled into a parking lot, crushing 2 other cars (no injuries thank God) in the process. I blacked out instantly, and woke up to the sound of bystanders asking if I was alive. Shortly after firefighters showed up and cut my sorry ass out of the driver seat, which was the only part of the car not completely crushed. 

After I was discharged from the hospital I went straight to a psych ward because attempted suicide. This is the point where my story becomes relevant to the thread. Likely due to the acid and intense stress of what just happened PLUS being confined to a psych ward isolated from my friends, family, and support network I started to develop signs of schizophrenia. I got the notion a fellow patient was an angel in human form, and he caught on and constantly fucked with me. At one point I was literally kissing the ground at this dude's feet. He advised me not to take my meds, which lengthened my stay in the facility substantially. I started obsessively reading the Bible (they had plenty of those in there lol), stopped eating, stopped sleeping, refused to go to those oh so helpful AA meetings, and would sit in the same position for hours just reading about how God fucked people up and eternal damnation and whatnot. I was pretty relieved when I got to the new testament lol. All the while I'm absolutely convinced Im gonna burn in hell, im seeing flames in the grains of the hardwood floor, I thought the nurses and some of the other patients were demons, I refused to see my parents when they came to visit because I thought they were impostors, shit was fucked up yo. 

After about a week I got discharged from that facility and put back in the hospital for malnutrition and dehydration. Unfortunately the damage had already been done, I continued to think my loved ones were demons just waiting to drag me to hell, which made for an interesting hospital stay since there were like 8 people there with me. (Which is awesome, thank God for my amazing family). I went from that hospital right back into a different psych ward, did about 14 days there in 2 separate stints with similar paranoid delusions. Its been 9 months since then and all those thoughts and the paranoia are still there. I get the feeling people are conspiring against me, that God is watching and judging me, that people can hear my thoughts, that all of this is a dream and Im in a coma, that my dead body is still in that car and this is the afterlife, that im still laying in bed tripping the fuck out, and many more. I've learned to dismiss these thoughts by applying a rationality filter, because I've got knowledge of how the world works and what makes sense and what doesn't, but I'll still get moments where my heart skips a beat and my mind starts racing through all the aforementioned possibilities. I know I'll never fully shake these feelings, but everyday I get a little better at telling them to fuck off.

TLDR: Dont do acid alone kidsI figured something was wrong when I couldn't stop thoughts from entering my mind and it lead to multiple crisises leading to hospitalization. But last year I was drugged with cool and it turned severe. In the aftermath of the drugging I suffered derealization and what I can only describe as ego boundries being somewhat lost. Or at least this is what me and my doctors have discussed as possible effects of my mental conditions. 

Thankfully I am on medications that inhibit the thoughts that are detrimental to my daily life.  Making me a high functioning schizophrenic. But thoughts of both paranoia and pronoia come to me because my mental condition is somewhat pattern seeking. Sorry if this doesnfully make sense. 

I was in my mid teens when I first started noticing that I was becoming more cautious of my actions and started overthinking things. At first, I thought I was smartening up and thinking "this is how I don't get the cops on my ass" (I smoked weed at the time and had already been harassed by cops for other reasons) or "obviously this person doesn't care for me because X, Y, and Z", but then it started getting worse. Actions taken to protect myself from authority led to actions taken to protect myself *because* authority figures were out trying to kill me by putting bugs (surveillance, not insects) in my walls, sending undercover cars (from beaters to BMWs) to follow me, and getting people to ask me about myself, so something as innocent as "Are you okay? You seem different" would be interpreted as "I know you're different. I need more information about you." in my eyes. I started hearing voices of people I love and people I didn't know telling me to kill myself or talking in word salad (e.g., "it smells like we've been here before", "fifteen minutes causes the life to dry"), and at the time, I didn't trust professional psychiatric help, so I tried treating what I thought was bipolar disorder (my blood family has it; mom, the sisters, and apparently a couple of other people) with vitamins and sunlight. The paranoia and voices took a seat on the back burner for a while, but I still felt uncontrollable mood swings and couldn't control my paranoia, and it wasn't until I was 20 that I decided that enough was enough and went to a psychiatrist. In between my late teens and the age of 20 though, my symptoms became worse. I didn't know the clinical name for what happened and still don't, so I'm using my own terms I used to my psychiatrist, but I'll define them:

* Head static: You know that feeling you get in a limb when it falls asleep? It was like that, except it would occur in my brain. I described it to my psychiatrist as a painless brain freeze.
* Thought deletion: Let's say I'm telling you a story or descibing something. "I can't figure out why she thinks that way, I mean I..." - and then that's it. Nothing. If you reminded me of what I was talking about, I wouldn't have remembered it, nor could I have found myself getting back on track and resuming the conversation. It was like losing an essay on Word without a way to recover it.
* Thought seizures: Out of nowhere I'd start shaking and spouting nonsense, almost like speaking in tongues. If I had to describe it, it'd be like an anxiety attack while shivering and trying to describe how to decline in Latin to a second grader that speaks another language than the one you're used to speaking in.

After describing all of this to my psychiatrist, he suggested that my combination of BPD and obvious symptoms of a psychotic mood disorder qualified me for the diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder. It took months of trying new medications (fuck Seroquil and its random stabbing headaches), but I finally suggested trying Thorazine to him, because my next option was going full ECT on my ass, and he agreed. Lo and behold, Thorazine helped me feel normal and steady for the first time since I was a teenager. I'm 22 now, and don't experience any of the symptoms I felt when I was unmedicated anymore, nor do I plan to. Knock on wood, hopefully I'll be able to keep taking my meds and stay this way so I can lead a full, productive life.I hallucinate people in my vicinity talking to me or about me and it can be hard to know what's real and isn't.  Probably almost none of it is real.  I knew when I was walking down the street and passing strangers would tell me to kill myself that it couldn't be real.  But even now I'm not 100% sure.  I saw it, saw his lips move and heard the words.  But there are also times when I'm completely alone and I hear voices or see things, so I know I must be hallucinating.  Still, I can't just dismiss things I experience as "not real".  It happened.  Anyway, I was diagnosed as a teenager and while I was homeless but right now I'm just on drugs for depression and anxiety.I didn't notice until I was already hospitalized. Looking back, though, I've seen a lot of warning signs. 

Shadow people following me around at a young age. They would chase me in my dreams. Now they chase me outside of my dreams sometimes. Walking in particular patterns and being afraid of the consequences of breaking the pattern. 

I have distinct memories of being assaulted by a young white boy with white parents in the apartment upstairs. According to my parents, the family that lived above us were all African American, and they lived there the whole time we did. 

Pretty antisocial behavior and personality. Not like dangerous, just apathetic. 

Hospitalized the first time for suicidal gestures a little over five years ago. Hospitalized last year for a suicide attempt and seratonin syndrome. I had beings telling me where to go and what to do. I was being spoken to out of music on the radio. I had conversations with dead relatives. Then I downed 90 days worth of SSRI's and nearly died. 

I have cognitive issues now, hard time annunciating words, and will often slip into similar sounding words via loose association. I have some neurological issues which hopefully aren't too severe, and I'm likely to die young due to kidney and/or liver failure due to my suicide attempts. 

AMA Reddit, it's my time to shine!I went to see a movie. At one point a teenager in it is beaten with a belt. It triggered a flash back to very similar things happening to younger me. I don't remember the next few days. But the next thing I do remember is a few days later waking up in the middle of the night hearing a collage of voices. I got up and stood in my sisters bedroom doorway, trying to figure out what was happening. I turned on the light to see if she was up. I remember her asking what's wrong and broke into tears and feel on the floor and said "I don't know" I told her things had gotten weird, what had been happening, and she didn't understand any of it because I was crying. 

A month or 2 later my dad (who I had been talking to about this as well) said he had a podcast I should listen to. He said it might explain things. It talked about a college aged woman as she realized she was schtizo. So much of it was so dead on, even the narrator. Finally agreed to call a therapist. Im so glad I did. Don't be afraid to get help, people. For anything. the therapist helped me with my disorder as well as childhood traumas. Later in life I was raped and shes helping me work through that as well. 

Tl:dr a movie triggered a bad memory and possibly the onset of my schizophrenia. Hearing my own name called out to me by people that were nowhere near me. I was once driving in a car by myself at 5am and I heard my coworker shout my name from my backseat. my coworker was 7 hours of driving away. At worst, several people, that sound like a crowd are shouting my name which can be disorienting.


Music playing is also the worst. I live in a dorm and even though everyone is pretty much asleep by 11:30-12:00, like clockwork I hear something similar to the Five Nights at Freddy's jingle playing from my walls. It isn't neighbors to the right, left, above, or beneath my dorm.


Shadow people walk around in my dreams and then transition into my dorm room and I wake up. They like to watch me when I sleep and stare at me when I am laying in bed in my dreams, then they walk out of my room or into my bathroom and I blink awake.


I am currently in therapy for it and there is no shame in looking for help. It is exhausting enough without it having to feel like a secret where I am hiding my "crazy" from my community.Great question.

I had had what are called psychotic features from age 13-18, but when I was 18 I had a full psychotic break. What were called features included some delusions, paranoia, and audio hallucinations that did not include commands. When I was 18, I was writing a lot of cryptic poetry about energies in the universe I had come to start thinking about because of a dream. Things in ordinary objects began to stick out to me as significant and meaningful, sometimes like they were messages to me. I started genuinely doubting that my dreams were not reality. I was thinking a lot about the personality of god.

For a few days, I cared less and less about anything I had ever known to be reality, and considering the unknowns of god became my sole focus, and I had a visual hallucination one night.

The next morning, I was alone in my parents' home, and they were both out of town. I had been smoking a joint and writing and listening to music, and a voice said "you have to quit smoking." I understood it, at the time, to be the voice of god, and my body sprung up from being reclined on my bed, to jumping up and down on all fours, out of excitement that god was real and that he had something to say. I fell on my back on my bed, and had a spontaneous orgasm.

For 2.5 years, the voice spoke to me nonstop. I was catatonic and non-lucid. I did stop hearing the voice eventually, and now I have no symptoms of any full-blown psychosis, just occasional audio hallucinations and some disorganized thought at times.

But during the days that preceded my psychotic break, I wrote in my notebook that I knew I was losing it, because when you consider your dreams to be reality, you're absolutely, undeniably crazy. But at the same time I believed it to be fully real, merely existing within the structure of what we know as illness. I wrote about how absurd it would be to choose lucidity over magic.

[edit] A clarification regarding chronology.[removed]Schizophrenia runs in my family, and usually it's under control but triggers like psychoactives or stress can bring it out. When I smoked weed for the first time with a few friends, I had visual and auditory hallucinations. At first I thought it was perfectly normal, until others said their experience was completely different. We were sitting on the couch watching Tosh.O, during a segment where he was doing an interview suddenly Tosh turned his head towards me and started commenting on what we were doing in a mocking way. At first I thought it was funny, until I told my friends what I saw and they seemed concerned. Ever since then if I feel an episode coming on I'm apprehensive about screens and especially faces, because they're an easy medium for my brain to manipulate into a hallucination. While I wasn't the one with it, I watched one of my friends crawl down this hellhole firsthand; and she took me with her. It was always aboult wolves. She had this whole thing where she thought she was this weird werewolf hybrid thing and had a second family of actual wolves. She'd always text me talking about what was going on. It got bad sometimes, to the point that she'd come to school really bad scratches on her arms from a "fight" she was in. Little kid me believed it because she had evidence to her claims and I was one gullible kid.

I met up with her again years later and she'd told me it was schizophrenia. I've always felt bad because the whole ordeal could've been prevented had I realized. But she's doing fine now as far as I know.I can’t quite remember. My first symptoms were negative symptoms. Um, maybe when I first attempted suicide because my voices told me to? I still didn’t think that was weird though, my dx kind of surprised me. 

Check out r/schizophrenia :)There is a form of audible paredoila, when your "hear" music, babbling etc. out of white noise, like fan motors, air conditions, engines, running water. THIS IS NORMAL. (I can hear this "babbling" and sometimes amazingly well done "music" by having a fan on). It's when your brain turns the noise into something it understands. Needless to say, I exactly know what it is (audible paredoila) and would never assume this is real music or mysterious voices talking.

This phenomenon can be confusing for some people. There had been situations where people complained about neighbors playing loud music late at night, because they heard this "music" when they had their AC running and misinterpreted is as their neighbors playing music. 

I am not a medical expert but I think it's important that people know this exists AND IT'S NOT SCHIZOPHRENIA, just a harmless audible illusion. It's actually quite entertaining and I enjoy it. (I sleep with a fan on, helps me sleep).

I can however see that someone who doesn't know this phenomenon exists MIGHT think they are schizophrenic. 

(To explain the internal "music" or the babbling...best to explain is it's like a radio playing in the neighbor's apartment, but at such a soft setting that you "hear" it but never actually "understand" what is being said.)

So, to the guy who thought he heard voices in the shower....there is a good chance you are NOT schizophrenic.
Voices in my head that are very negative and critical of me. Hearing things like an airplane crash into the building I worked at and I'm the only one that notices it. Seeing people who aren't there, have no shadows or shadows are wrong, people walk through them and they walk through walls. Negative thoughts as well.

Sometimes my brain emulates other people I know or met and gives me thoughts from them, almost like being in a dream but being awake. I'm not always here like I am part here and part somewhere else.The first time I noticed something was when I was 12 after my dad’s funeral when he’d still wake me up every morning.Late to the thread but the first time I really noticed it was when I was talking to my neighbor when I was about 16, he said something but the words came out as "They're watching you". There was other stuff before that looking back, I just didn't notice at the time. If I'm stressed it gets worse, I'll look out my window and see what looks like people hiding in the bushes staring at me. One time I looked outside at night and there were a ton of orbs of light or something, I couldn't figure out what it was or think of a logical explanation, I had to get my dad to tell me if what I was seeing was real(it wasn't). The first time I saw something that didn't belong was when I was 18 and driving home from the casino.  It was a very strange light pattern in the middle of an open field.  It was moving too fast to be an airplane, and was moving horizontally and vertically so it couldn't be a car.  I did my best to try to watch it, but I was driving and this was before phones had cameras.  I've done the drive countless times in my life, but have only seen it once.

The next time I encountered something that didn't belong was 3 months later.  It was 2 months before high school graduation and I recently moved out.  I was renting a room in a 2 story house and my room was upstairs.  It was raining and windy, but clear enough to see into the distance.  Just above the tree line, I saw it waving back and forth.  It looked like a streetlight, but it was looking at me.  I watched it for at least a half an hour before trying to find a roommate.  Unfortunately, nobody was home.

Two weeks later, it came back.  It was waving back and forth again, but it was always facing me.  I did the only thing rational at the time, I ran down the street to find it.  When I arrived at the location, the only thing there was a streetlight.  It didn't move, it didn't wave, it didn't stare.  It never came back.

I went back to the corner several times to make sure it didn't move. Unfortunately, I haven't seen it again.  I want to see it, I want to find it, and I'm always carryied a camera or my phone so that if it does show up, I'd have proof.  Deep inside, I know it will never show up.  I know this because the pattern is the same pattern I saw when driving.

I was first diagnosed with Bipolar psychosis in 2004.  In a weird turn of events, immediately after the diagnosis, my doctor ended up going to prison.   I ended up in a crisis center.  I got stuck with an NP(did not know he wasn't a doctor).  He modified my meds, increased the dosages, and thought that I may be developing schizophrenia.  

The medication made things worse.  I would "wake up" standing in the hardware section of Lowes.  No idea how I got there, but I knew where my car was in the parking lot.  I would have violet outbursts.  I became a black-belt in drywall-fu. I would take substantial risks

I don't remember most of what happened the next 7-8 years of my life.  My medications kept increasing, my doctors changed.  In the end, I was taking seroquel xr (800mg), lithium (1200mg), lamictal (300mg), and trazodone (150mg).  I also had 25mg seroquel (non-xr) for mornings when I felt like I was losing control.  

In 2012 it all stopped.  I was sitting in my living room and playing on my iPad.  I open up notes and there were pages of memories.  Some were written in first person, others in third.  Some were extremely angry, some were suicidal.  Some of them made no sense.  Then I heard the voice.  I was told that it was my time to steer the ship.

It took just over 2 years to get off the medication, and I haven't had anything since.  I haven't gotten lost, the light is gone, and the voice hasn't returned.  In 2015, I went back to look at the light pole.  I wanted to try to figure out if it was an optical illusion.  Crazy thing is, it was never there to begin with. 

Only my first doctor knows about the light.  I've never told anyone about the voice.  There are still things inside me that I will never be able to tell anyone.  I'm very thankful for what I have now.Wow... This single thread has really humanized this disease to me.  I never really had any first hand experience with it and barely know anyone who suffers from this.  

Everyone who is fighting this is so damn brave.  I don't think I would be able to fight it myself.  

The most interesting part to me was the conversations of people describing their experiences and sharing the similarities.  I felt like a fly on the wall soaking everything in.  

ALL the conversations here were so damn interesting and very relatable in a way that someone who doesn't have it can at least a little understand what it's like.

Two things I found interesting was the 'stereotypical' way schizophrenics walk and weed exacerbating the disease.  In some ways maybe I could relate because when I (rarely) do edibles, my senses are COMPLETELY heightened and I feel like I can hear even the subtlest things.  For example, when I'm at home with my wife and we're doing it, We'd be having fun and talking and eating, but at the same time, I can hear other people's conversations outside when the window is open and they are pretty far away.  Also, I feel like everyone knows that I'm high as a kite, even though they are random people on the street who I know doesn't give a shit. haha

I'm totally ignorant about this subject, but can it be in some ways that schizophrenics are way more sensitive to external forces to the point that they internalize all the stimuli and it pours out in a-typical ways?

Everyone shared their stories when they were younger and it made me think if I had any similarities.  I can't say I heard or saw things, but I distinctly remember being scared to go to bed sometimes because I would imagine going down a huge funnel and when I looped and looped all the way to the end, I would find myself in a really malleable tube (almost like going through intestines).  No one was chasing me or no reason to be scared other than when it was dark and claustrophobia (which didn't bother me), even before sleeping, I would imagine/dream these things.  Another interesting thing about it is that I would get a really distinct taste in my mouth right before it would happen... almost like I sucked on a copper bar or something like that.  I think the last time I experienced it was when I was 9, almost 10 and nothing after that.

Anyway, very very interesting topic and I'm so glad to learn more about this.  For those who are suffering, hang in there.  It seems like there's a lot of people who are going through it and they are doing well!

[deleted][removed]Late reply but I️ noticed myself asking people “what was that?” even though they didn’t actually say anything and then I️ realized it was just me When I couldn't tell whether the voices were in my head or in real lifeI started hearing noises, not voices, that no one else could hear. Stuff like horns honking or a radio playing music. This affected me harshly and I ended up fearing that people either constantly thought negatively of me as a crazy person, or would actually plot to kill me.When I was about 8 I was sleeping on the floor in my parents camping trailer and I heard 6-7 different voices male and female talking to me and each other, I was sick with the flu at the time so I thought it was symptoms of the flu, medication, and lack of sleep. Nothing else really happened until I was 12-13. I started seeing silhouettes of a person standing in weird places, like by my parents bedroom or peering at me from behind the fridge. I would also hear people telling my name when I was alone in the house or at a friends. It got to the point where I convinced myself that certain people were at a different "level" in their abilities to read my mind or know what I was going to do, I would only drink bottled water because I thought the government put a canister on the water lines that was set to release chemicals when I would shower or use the sink. I finally told my mom about it all one night when 15, I was drunk and I was having another episode. I was sitting in my moms truck and I saw someone standing beside the passenger window staring at me. It looked like a guy in his 40's, and he was just standing there staring. She didn't know if I was being honest or drunkenly rambling but I told her so much detail about everything I saw she couldn't doubt me. She asked me about it in the morning and I was in a counselors office the next afternoon. Since then I've been on and off mess trying to find the right ones that help me. I've tried 8 different medications in the past year and none of them seem to help much. One day at a time  Schizophrenia for me was induced by stress followed by a psychotic episode with full blown voices, hallucinations, and odd behavior.

It all started when I worked at this odd job with unorthodox businessmen.  I was doing okay at first, but as I became more and more engulfed with the job I ended up psychotic. I was doing unorthodox business under their rule and had a gun pointed to me at one point; This constituted as a stressor of course.  As I continued head strong working this job, I also began to notice that I was becoming more agitated by their orders and became slower at the job performance.  I started thinking to myself how  the porn industry, sexual conduct, and biblical lust was the end of the world.  This gave me the paranoia  when on the job. I would visit clients homes believing they might have something to do with my thoughts on porn- whether they were a porn CEO or actor.  

In the midst of all this, I told customers I was guilty of watching porn, told them how bad I thought it was, and thought someone would want to have an affair with me.  On going, I started thinking how things were interconnected with each other as I did my work in unison with my thoughts on sex.  For example, I would insert a bolt on something I was working on and thought I was corrupting a pornstar from performing. 

There on, I began classes at school and started repeating everything the professor would say under my breath, draw conclusions about things using the lectures being taught, and telling my professor isis is actually wonder woman.(almighty isis!) During this, I drove long distances late at night believing it would reset my mindset while in the process almost being arrested for parking at the top of a national forest in the middle of nowhere.  I noticed the same model vehicles on the road and associated them with people I knew who owned them and thought they were significant to my delusional mind.  

My boss recieved texts from me in different languages and rude messages about people. Which led him to believe I was doing acid.  I truthfully declined and continued on this way.  I spent ridiculous amount money on my credit card buying useless things and didn't think about my future self being in the state of mind I was in. 

As the days went on, I started hearing voices late at night from all sorts of people I have known. I told my mom that I could hear someone's voice which gave her an idea something wasn't right.  

Eventually, I was let go from my job because I lost the mental and physical strength to my work.  I increasingly got more lazy and slept most the time at home.  My parents admitted me to the hospital for evaluation after I started burning books and bible scriptures because I thought God was angry with me.   In the hospital was when schizophrenia for me got the worse for my mental state. I started hearing voices, having hallucinations, and remember thinking I am going to het locked up for good.  

This whole time I did not know what schizophrenia was, so I was just staying head strong in the 51/50 I was transferred to.  After a few days of evaluation, I was diagnosed and on medication. (Invega Sustenna) 

After being released, voices and delusions faded away.  I took a year off of school and work to make a full recovery. Now, I am doing better then when I had no symptoms.

Definitely the worst time of my life during that job which is what I believe helped bring schizophrenia in me to surface.  During this last year,  I work full time have lots of friends and graduating from school this year.

I hear a small collection of voices, like a busy office. If I get stressed or anxious they start to shout and scream at me. About 50 voices.[removed]I'm currently 20, I first noticed my symptoms when I was around 14. 

It wasn't completely obvious at first, just minor things. Like I would be in a room alone and I'd constantly see things that weren't there, and out of the corner of my eye. I'd have constant and repetitive messages being whispered to me every once in a while, but at the time given my age and Inexperience, I didn't think much of it, just brushed it off.

After my parents divorce was when it became much worse. I down spiraled very quickly, seeing and physically feeling things that weren't there in the room. The voices that were once a faint whisper were much louder and constant. All of this along with the divorce gave me a constant state of paranoia and I developed bipolar disorder. Eventually I was hospitalized for it on 3 separate occasions. During that time I tried out countless medicines and Doses to try and help me stay stable.

These days I'm doing quite well. I've been on the right medication for 6 years now, and with the help of therapy I truly feel I'm very stable. It's scary when I look back at what happened to a kid that young, but I've learned from it and grown.

Parents/family: If your kid comes to you and tells you about symptoms like I had, don't punish them or freak out. These days there are hundreds of offices designed specially to help people with this disorder. Reach out and do your best to help them, it may just set them on the right path :)I used to hear voices. I never really thought it was an issue, sometimes I would hold conversations when I was board. It was when the voices started to disagree with me and form their own opinions that I became worried.[deleted]I just want everyone in the comments to know how strong and capable they are. Even with multiple meds. Even with multiple doctors. Even when things are really bad. Because it's YOU who is dealing with it and YOU who is learning and implementing the coping strategies. Therapists or psychiatrists HELP, but it's you who is doing the grunt work. Always remember that. You are not solely your illness... Speaking from experience here. Take care of yourselves and take things one day at a time. I work as a CNA at a skilled nursing facility. We have many schizophrenic residents. One lady will talk about the blue fairy who steals her things. She is an absolute sweetheart most of the time though. There is another women has a host of mental issues however her schizophrenia is her predominant issue, she is very difficult to understand, speaks in broken sentences and uses the wrong words because she just cannot get her thoughts straight. She is obsessed with god and the devil. Very common for schizophrenics, they believe the voices as either god/devil or both talking to them. She wrote a letter to Jesus saying she is still a virgin, she is a mother of 3. One man who prefers to go by "The wizard Starcraft Raven Hawk", wears a wizard cape and plays heavy death metal almost constantly. He is a truly great guy, living on his own now and I will miss him. We had one man who was also developmentally delayed, he would randomly shout out "Shut up!" Made a lot more sense when I learned he was schizophrenic. 

There was one man who stood out from the rest though. He was obsessed with religion, could quote most of the bible off of memory alone. Was hyper-focused and sexually aggressive with women and accused them of being the whore of Babylon sent by the devil to steal his soul. Asked me one day how to get the dead babies back inside of him, he masturbated. Said he could not take a bath because "as the water would drain from the tube, so would his friends souls drain into hell."  Accused me of putting a serpent on his bed, on my first day. The nurse had to "check" my pockets for serpents. Most of the time though, he just sat in his room and sang hymens or tried to paint. 

I would like to say, none of these people are dangerous. That are all weird, and a bit intimidating at first. However, these people are a much greater threat to themselves than they are to anyone else. That is why they are hospitalized. To keep them from committing suicide. They were some of the nicest people I have ever met and truly deserve our help and protection. [removed][removed]It happened right after I turned 19. I would hear music in my house at night and accuse my sister of playing music when she never actually did. It then progressed to not another voice in my head, but my own telling me what I do wrong all the time. I've always been very lonely, and I always talk to myself and make voices for fun, but I started noticing a voice I've never made in my peripheral hearing, just regular things at first but then it would tell me people are betraying me and hated me and I got so paranoid I tried to bleed enough that he'd die and I'd be free. I nearly died, but I never heard him again. I've never been that scared of a friend in my head(makes it less ominous) but I'd get much less real voices telling me to do things, one that never goes away tells me people are going to mollest me if I go into a bathroom alone, assumably because I'm high school I did get sexually assaulted in the bathroom multiple times ( I am bisexual and had a boyfriend, and I went to an all boys high school and someone found out) and I need to wait until someone goes into a public restroom before I can. I'm a functioning human being and no one knows except my parents and my brother, considering he found me yelling at no one in the middle of the night.16yo. Turned my radio off and some bitch jus kept on talkinI always think that someone's out to kill me. I always have a weapon ready next to my bed. I couldn't sleep nor eat because of it. I also see things - at my worst I saw cockroaches crawling all over me which lead to numerous panic attacks in just the span of a week. I also thought that my cat was controlling me and almost went crazy when a voice told me to kill my family. I was always an anxious child and was always a crybaby. Maybe that was a sign. I also hallucinated smells like something was always burning. I'm on medication now.[removed]My dad has schizophrenia. He is quite embarassed about it, so he will not discuss what it's like in his mind. I can notice when he is having an episode when he no longer joins conversation, like he cannot hear when actual people are talking to him. Then he will respond to the voices-burst into tears, laugh, get mad. He stays awake weeks on end. Drinks water incessantly. Moves his feet, rubs his fingers for hours and hours into days, only communicating with his hallucinations. Then he gets angry. We are out to get him, he thinks. Scary movies on TV he believes happened to him. Delusions of grandeur- he was sent from God to save his evil children and fallen angel wife...I have so many stories. His longest episode lasted 4 months. He used to have them seasonally, in the fall and spring. He will also have one when exposed to great stress. He hasn't had an episode in probably 7 years now. Thank God for Haldol.Schizoaffective Dissorder. When i get overly emotional, I will hear audible whispers/mumbles. At its worse, I see blurred shadows sway and jump. I get super dizzy as well. After an episode, I feel like I hadn't slept and I am achy. First time was when I was 15. One of my friends, whom we trusted, stole my dad's box of lures. My dad was a tournament angler. For anyone that may not know, some lures can be as high as 10-15 bucks. That was the first time I felt truly angry and emotional over something. Just a few days ago when i started a new medicine and realized maybe it isn't normal to have 7 me's in my head all thinking different thingsHearing my dead best friend screaming for help from Hell.A very interesting Ted talk from a schizophrenic that should answer all of your questions.

https://www.ted.com/talks/eleanor_longden_the_voices_in_my_head/up-next[removed]I don't have schizophrenia, but I have a related illness called schizotypal personality disorder, that is essentially the same, except with less to no delusions.

Honestly, nothing has ever been /right/. In hindsight, I can see that I've had some serious issues since I was 10, but the moment I noticed that something wasn't right was when I ended up homeless because I could no longer function properly as an adult. Apparently, I had covered up all my windows with newspaper to block light from coming in at my worst. 

I've always had audiovisual hallucinations, extreme difficulties holding any sort of tangible control over my own thoughts and a voice in my head I actually sort of like and can't really live without at this point.

My typical hallucinations are the sounds of doorbells (which is why I tore out the doorbell in my apartment in a fit of rage once, so now I don't have to go to my front door to check if anyone actually rings it anymore, since I know a ring is a hallucination and a knock is the real deal), walls, floors and other stationary objects having their surface "Move around" like in [this gif](http://i.imgur.com/w9ygNoP.gif), sensory input crashing into my thoughts, rendering them into mental noise when I'm exhausted (like my senses and thoughts destructively overlap, my sight getting fuzzy under harsh noise levels, thoughts being harder to make out too). Oh, there's always someone standing in the corner of my vision. It makes a great jumpscare every once in a while to see -something- when I'm supposed to be alone in the room. Also, I get immensely uncomfortable when my windows aren't covered up for some reason. I can live with it in other people's apartments and in places like work or other public places, but I can't for the love of me stand having my own windows exposed.This one goes out to the ones reading who haven't gotten a diagnosis or are just reading along to learn more.

1)  Having hallucinations does not automatically mean a diagnosis of schizophrenia.  There are many conditions that can come with a side of psychosis.  Even urinary tract infections in the elderly can cause hallucinations.  If you, or someone you love, is experiencing hallucinations and has not gone through the diagnostic process yet (and it is a process), do not jump the gun and assume schizophrenia.  Go find a good doctor (and that part can take work), and get a proper diagnosis done.  It's the only way to know what it is.

2)  Having hallucinations has it's own spectrum.  I describe it as how animation can be used in conjunction with live action.  It can be anywhere from one tiny thing in one tiny scene to a live action character living in an animated world.  The only way to know where the person experiencing the hallucinations is on that spectrum is to ask them.

3)  Not all hallucinations are scary.  Many are annoying.  Some are funny.  Some can even be pretty.  But most of them.... they're just there.  The bubbles I hallucinate coming from lights at night, they're pretty.  The book that turned into a dachshund on the bus?  Definitely giggle worthy.  Again, don't assume you know what the person is going through.  Ask them.

4)  Please understand that for all mental illnesses, they are discovering a neurological, physical basis.  As in our brains initially develop as physically different, beginning with our earliest development in utero.  They are all physical illnesses.  If you wouldn't say it about a physical illness, please don't say it about ours.  

If you are interested in links to some of the neurological research that has been coming out on mental illness, please let me know.  I am happy to provide links.I've never been diagnosed with any mental health issues but here is my story. Not sure where it goes

Ever since I was 9 or 10 I hear voices at various times of the day. Usually when I'm laying down at night. I hear screams and many people talking VERY loudly. Can't ever make out what they are saying but it's always very loud. Its been 14 years and they still sporadically occur.Follow up question: Does anyone with schizophrenia ever hear voices that tell them to do good things like volunteer at a charity or bake cookies and give them to your neighbor?I don't have schizophrenia, but my partner does and this is what she relayed to me:

When I was about 6 or 7, I was sitting in bed at night and there was a woman who walked into my room. She just stood in the doorway, staring at me. I ran into my closet and hid, because she didn't FEEL right. It felt like she wasn't real. Almost like a ghost, like everything around her was fake or had a blue halo.

Later, I told my parents, but they told me I hadn't seen anything. I ended up lying to them and my doctors for fear of being locked up.

The paranoia started later, when I started driving. I ended up having to memorize the cars behind me. I used to carry a gun in the car for fear people were following me. Were going to do something to me.

Since I've gotten older, I've gotten much better at recognizing what's real and not real. I'm on medications and things, but I can tell myself they aren't real now and my brain will tune them out.I have been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, depressive type (which is pretty much just means schizophrenia and depression). 

A bit of background: during childhood, I was diagnosed with OCD and during early adolescence I was diagnosed with depression. In my early 20s I was diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder and PTSD. Interestingly enough, shortly before developing full blown symptoms of OCD as a child I had a period where I would get extremely worried that my friends parents were videoing me and could see and hear my thoughts. 

My onset of schizoaffective disorder was extremely gradual; I had symptoms for several years before being diagnosed. The symptoms began when I was about 22, when I started worrying about putting my hair and fingernail clippings in the bin; I thought people would use a them and place them at a crime scene in order to frame me for a crime. 

This then turned into what I just thought was a more extreme manifestation of OCD and PTSD: I began to have difficulty sleeping, I was agitated and anxious and I began to feel less comfortable socialising. My brain function slowed down and I could not concentrate and my coping abilities worsened. I began to obsess over religion, worrying that every action I did was offensive to God in some way. 

I began to believe that I could control what happened in the world with my mind. There was a presence that permeated the atmosphere everywhere and it would send me “signals” of the rituals I had to perform, in order to prevent bad things from happening to me and my family. This could be stuff like repeating the same words over and over, drinking a particular brand of cordial, etc. 

Over time, I began to scrutinise every action I took, to analyse every possible risk of harm to myself and others. I believed everyone was out to harm me or my family or I worried excessively about upsetting another person. I was constantly on high alert. I thought my colleagues were contaminating my food and drink at work; I believed that one of my colleagues was smearing STD contaminated blood onto the toilets at work to harm me.

Then I had to have a performance review at work with a new manager (we have to have them every year and they take a couple of hours - they’re extremely thorough and go through in detail all of the feedback they have collated about you). My manager also mentioned at the said review they had something important they wanted to discuss with me but did not specify what. 

Well, I completely freaked. I was convinced that they thought I had done something wrong. I stopped sleeping more than an hour a night; I was a complete mess, rocking back and forth on my bed. I was convinced my managers were video recording me whenever I left the house and had tapped my phone in order to try and find evidence to fire me. I began to worry if I went outside and a plane flew overhead that it was law enforcement looking for me, convinced I had committed a crime. I drew symbols on my hand in order to “protect” myself in some way and I began accusing my loved ones of thinking/doing bad things about me. I thought the neighbours were spying on me and trying to gather evidence to also get me prosecuted for something when I hadn’t done anything wrong. Then I had apparently had a couple of visual hallucinations; I didn’t realise that’s what they were at the time. I also believed I was evil inside and had black creatures inside me. I cut all my hair off. 

Eventually I ended up seeing a psychiatrist and I’m on medication now. I ended up having a long denial period, thinking what I had was just anxiety or depression. I’ve relapsed a few times during periods of my life that have been stressful or when I’ve tried reducing or stopping my medication. 

Its kinda like talk radio in my head that can't turn off. When i was younger it was really bad.  I used to think that there were ghosts in everything.  Being a roudy teenager i ate a lot of mushrooms and that cured me of believing that ghosts were everywhere.  It was just my own brain on overdrive. I realized something was wrong back then. I would hear people beating on my back door.Always nine  quick knocks.  I would get paranoid and walk around my apartment with a butcher knife.  I would hear bees buzzing around my head. This kept me up all night. It was horrible.  Started off when I️ was very young. I️ was about 3 years old and seeing people that look like cartoons, it seemed off to me and it freaked me out so much that I️ would start crying and my parents didn’t know what was going on. Later on during the nights I️ would hear voices calling my name. Whispers or screaming. They were unfamiliar but sometimes sounded like people I️ knew, people that have never been to my house. I️ would respond and say “what?” Or start screaming again. My mom thought nothing of it when I️ was little. 2 years ago when I️ was 17 I️ had the worst panic attack and was sent to the hospital. I️t took a while to calm me down. My mom scheduled an appointment with a therapist and a psychiatrist. I️ was diagnosed with schizophrenia, ADHD, bipolar disorder, depression, and anxiety. This is my first real comment on Reddit so I’ll do my best. Sorry it’s long!

I just want to preface this by saying when I tell this story sometimes people think I’m lying about the part that weed played in this or that I’m disagreeing on the medicinal properties it has, I am absolutely not, it just didn’t work out for me. My doctor said it was likely that I was predisposed for all of this and that this sort of triggered it.

Mine was a little bit different than some other people because it was all at once, with some symptoms evolving over the years. When I was about 15 I started smoking pot, I did it a few times and it always ended in panic attacks for me but I was young and wanted to fit in so I did it a few one more times and something immediately was not right. I felt so so afraid and out of my body and scared. Like I heard someone was screaming and then would focus really hard and it was me. This lasted a few days with me avoiding my parents until finally I went to my dad and told him the score. My parents were really kind about it and took me to the hospital. They didn’t help at all but the problems I had In the medical system are another story. 

After that basically what I felt was terrified. My number one paranoia was that people were poisoning my food. I couldn’t eat anything that wasn’t in a sealed package because I was sure someone had poisoned it and even then I was sure that the people at the factory had poisoned it. I would literally gain the courage to eat and then lay down on my couch waiting for death which I was sure was coming. I thought ever car behind me was trying to kill me and I would drive circles around my block before I got home to “shake them”. I worked a job where I had my back to the door all day at a till and every time someone walked in I was sure they would come up behind me and slit my throat. 

The symptoms sort of evolved over the years but another thing that was there right away was the derealization and depersonalization. Nothing ever felt real, like I was in a nightmare I couldn’t wake up from. I didn’t feel like myself, I felt I was watching a movie of myself or that I was watching me while standing behind myself? Sometimes in the middle of a conversation I would think to myself “who is talking??” And then realize it was me talking without really realizing it. Like I was partitioned off in a different part of my brain.

There was also audio and visual hallucinations, the audio ones was either my dad yelling my name loudly and angrily (he’s very nice and never yells so it was strange) and weird things like a lawn mower in winter. I also smelled this gross sickly sweet smell sometimes when there was no cause for it and saw things like people but when I looked closer they weren’t there.

I’m now doing a lot better but that was basically my original symptoms. I would be happy to answer any questions! 


	
Well this will definitely get buried but here it goes.

First time I noticed something wasn't right was the very first time I hallucinated. I'm discounting sleep paralysis as hallucinations because a lot of neurotically people experience that too and it's pretty much just dreaming. But the first waking hallucination I had was a voice saying "Don't worry he can't even hear us right now" with the "he" referring to me. My first thought was "fuck I'm crazy". You hear a lot of stories of psychotics not being able to distinguish between reality and delusions or hallucinations but for what ever reason I can, and could right of the bat. I didn't think the voices were angels or demons or spirits or other peoples thoughts or thoughts people were planting in my head, I didn't think they had access to any great truths or and information that I didn't have access too, I just knew they were hallucinations talking bullshit.Honestly I wouldn’t have known what schizophrenia was if I hadn’t read a fictional book about schizophrenia in 8th grade for class. 

I was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 9th grade. I started noticing that something was wrong when electronics were talking to me and I felt like I was always being followed by people from my past. I also had more auditory hallucinations where people were in my head. I distinctly remember breaking down in my psychologists office saying that I heard voices and that I thought I had schizophrenia. 

Later I started seeing a psychiatrist, got diagnosed, started treatment and got medicated.

I haven’t heard voices in years. It does get better, just seek treatment!I’m 28 and I don’t hear voices regularly but I’ve had several odd experiences with auditory hallucinations. 

The first I can remember I was around 7 or 8 and suffered from terrible insomnia. I was anxious about sleeping for some reason and then that lead me to be anxious about getting to sleep. At one point I distinctly remember hearing the phrase “we win” over and over in a decreasing tone. Scared the shit out of me but eventually I got over it. 

The second was in basic training. It was the 3rd or 4th night and I hadn’t slept more than 3 hours the whole time. I was trying to sleep and I heard deafening laughter. Like drown out every thought kind of laughter. I started crying and I don’t know what happened but something snapped and reset on me because after that night I slept fine. 

The last time was on a deployment. I hadn’t been able to sleep and started taking unisom (fuck that shit btw) and right before I’d drift to sleep I’d hear someone come in my room and scream. It happened a few times and then stopped. 

I don’t think I’m schizophrenic but could stress or exhaustion be a catalyst for the syndrome? I remember asking my mom if I was crazy as a kid and she would tell me as long as I wonder that I’m okay. It helped me then but I don’t know if it was really true haha. I think I’ve just had pretty bad anxiety. Which worries me because I have 2 little boys and my wife also suffers from anxiety...This is too freaky about to hop out of this threadReading all these stories of people who see people who aren't truly there... Makes me wonder if I spend my days walking empty streets without knowing it I said “what was that?” To my mom thinking she said something. She was in the other room. I started seeing things that seemed fine but slowly I started to realise I wasn’t supposed to see them. Voices started soon after but by that point I was already at an in-patient facility. A good thing that came out of all of this was that it really made me reevaluate the importance of family and showing you care. It made it a lot easier to deal with. Lots of people saying, “Me, too!”  These symptoms can be experienced by “normal people” occasionally and by people with other conditions more often than occasionally.

I have narcolepsy that went undiagnosed for over two decades.  There were times, even as a kid, that I was so sleep-deprived that I would see the shadow people. I saw shadows turn into dancing people once as a kid trying to nap, my reflection sometimes didn’t match my movements in the mirror, and I see people or feel the presence of something horrible when I have sleep paralysis attacks.  Five years ago, I heard a conversation coming from inside my pillow.  I’d raise my head and the voices would change perspective - like, it wasn’t “in my head”, my brain made the voices louder the closer I got to the pillow and quieter as I’d distance my ear.  I still sometimes see my parents rounding corners as I’m walking around town (they passed away not too long ago).  

I rarely see or hear things since I’ve been sleeping better.  Honest to god, though, every time it happened, I’d be terrified beyond belief.  I never got used to it, and there was a time it’d happen at least once a week.  I can’t even comprehend living with these hallucinations fulltime.  I got prescribed SSRIs for depression when I was 18 and after a few days I started experiencing like 30 different adverse effects and got really paranoid. Constantly kept thinking I was bleeding internally and was gonna die or something, even after I stopped taking citalopram.
Took me a while to realise I can't handle caffeine anymore. Anything beyond 40mg has the potential to make me really psychotic and anxious like 5hrs after taking it (at first it makes me manic but it's not worth the anxiety that can take days to go away)
I started treating myself with nootropics like l-theanine, l-tyrosine, NAC. Have been smoking weed everyday, since I was 16. It has more pros then cons to me because it makes me able to stay calm and think clearly, although I do know most schizophrenics experience worse symptoms when smoking weed, like my sister who gets really nervous etc. on it where it does the complete opposite for me cause I'm used to it and it's traumatising for me when I don't smoke(cold turkey at least)

Anyway, with the l-theanine, it only lasts like 3 hours or something, so once you're using it throughout the day you shouldnt just quit early especially with using large doses like me but tapering is really easy with not much craving.

I didn't think it the withdrawal could be so intense because the effects didn't seem to intense to me, they're very subtle because it practically makes you feel like a sober person and makes  almost all kinds of stress/anxiety disappear. So the withdrawal does the exact opposite and causes one to experience pure stress in amounts that easily cause a burnout etc.

So I didn't really know that when  I forgot my theanine at home while I was hanging out at a friend's house with some other people. 


They wanted to do some acid, so I called a friend who knew where to get some and went with them to get it. One of the guys had snuffing tobacco(don't know if that's the right term)


I tried some and it was only afterwards that he told me that there was some caffeine in them which made me manic and trip
As a thanks, they offered to give me some but at first I was like no but kept asking and I was like what the hell, like 3/4 a tab shouldn't be too hard to handle, but I've never been so wrong in my life. So, instead of asking them to drive me home, I decided to stay. The l-theanine withdrawal made the trip so intense and stressful that I started hearing voices and thinking that other people like the government or some secret organisations listening to my thoughts etc.


Took me loads of different antipsychotics and like 6 months to realise the voices arent real. Now it's like 1.5yrs later. Voices are still there, but barely. 
I do have my mind pretty much under control, not drinking coffee and avoiding antidepressants (besides mdma) and cold turkey withdrawals.
Just stopped taking benzos a couple of days ago, because although they are less subtle, they actually make the problems worse over time, as opposed to theanine which helps because of the neuroplasticity of the brain while the brain is less depressed so you forget less. It's also great for tapering benzos, just watch out to never quit that stuff cold turkey
Same for tyrosine.

I also find tyrosine "deactivates" most effects by benzos so you can take like 10x your normal dose and feel nothing. You have to wait at least like 5hrs after dosing tyrosine if you want to experience benzo effects but the tyrosine also helps with the anxiety, forgetfulness, etc. so it's great for taking like 1-3 times early in the day[deleted]I've always questioned this, mostly because I naturally want someone to talk to, and I feel like there are two of me.  I'm always watching other people and feel as if people are afraid of me as in my very presence disturbs them.  I've usually always felt like I am battling myself and that I have to be vigilant against my more impulsive nature.[removed]I think I had psychosis a few days ago. I can’t tell if  my dreams are real or not anymore. I’m failing exams I already passed. I thought my boyfriend was bringing my ex home to assault me when he came back from holiday, but I’d dreamt it all and my texts are stupid. Whenever my boyfriend goes to the kitchen I can hear knifes being sharpened. I have anxiety but the meds aren’t working anymore. I can’t sleep because someone’s trying to open my door. I know this is wrong but it’s real. Someone followed me home from work today eating frozen sausages, I know they didn’t but it doesn’t make sense. The timing of this post is wrong. My boyfriend thinks I’m drunk but I’m not.I am going to get /r/iamverybadass'ed for this, I'm sure, as it always happens.

But, no, I did the US Army thing, nearly died in Iraq, developed schizophrenia around my late-20's (which is apparently when it can happen for males with triggers) along with PTSD, anxiety, depression, paranoia, and a fuckton of anger issues that never go away where Iraq was the trigger.

There's that literal and figurative kill switch soldiers and Marines are installed that is normally controllable by the individual: to go from a normal decent and civilized human being one second, to a giggling bloodthirsty mindless berserker the next, then back again as necessary, so you can fight your worst when there are enemies, and be your best when otherwise.

My switch is broken thanks to the schizo.

I didn't realize how fucked up I was until I ended up in jail for nearly murdering a whole bunch of people in one of those angered, thoughtless rages.

I've had to do a LOT of therapy, counseling, and taking a lot of medications alongside being often self-reflective to try and catch the madness before it starts.  And I've caught it a few times before; managing to get myself into a VA institution where I couldn't hurt others or myself while the docs tried to figure out what went wrong there.

Seems like the medication is working full-time and well now, though.  It took years, and a lot of bad experiences, but I live in a state with an exceptionally great VA, so my prognosis isn't like Phoenix, AZ's veterans can be.

If if lived in Phoenix, though, I probably wouldn't be here right now, and so wouldn't some other people.

I know it's bad when the thought of killing people is like thinking about future sex.At night I kept hearing people talking outside my apartment. At the beginning I just thought it was neighbors. Soon I heard my name called like a whisper. Now most the time I hear a crowd, like a mall or playground, wherever I am.I get psychotic when things are bad (not schizophrenic, either bipolar or bpd, my psychiatrists are in conflict) and I guess looking back I can pinpoint the first time something was off because I started seeing people looking at me. like I became hyperaware of people staring at me or turning their heads to look at me or even passing eye contact in the street and my brain just started building this super elaborate fantasy that I was being tracked and watched and bullied by people. it was really horrible but. haven't had paranoia like that again. now I get delusions and hallucinations about maggots in my teeth and tapeworms (I have an eating disorder so I throw up a lot and when things are bad the vomit is just FULL of worms to me, I've gotten hysterical and scooped it out of the toilet to pick through before) and skin parasites (I have dermatillomania and eczema so my skin is always itchy). sometimes I also feel like I can tell the future or hear "secret music" that has messages encoded for me.
I was diagnosed schizoaffective when I was 24, but began treatment for mental illness at 17 following symptoms since the age of eight that had gone ignored by a negligent mother. As a kid, I toe walked, was very stiff in my movements, and had no facial expressions and a flat affect. My mom made me sit in front of a mirror and practice appropriate facial expressions so I wouldn't 'look angry all the time'. When I was a kid, I heard music in my head all the time and got absorbed into playing pretend. My imaginary friends were real, and I would get so invested in 'worlds' that I became other people and lived other lives. I had my first manic break when I was twelve and regularly slept three hours a night and was generally hyperactive and manic in my behavior. I became depressive following a traumatic experience at age 15, and began self injuring. Slowly, the self injury began to be instigated by command hallucinations, and it spiraled out of control from there. 

I remember distinctly my first real psychotic episode; I was walking in a graveyard in the snow and a tree wrapped in barbed wire began talking to me, asking me to set it free. I also saw a lake that wasn't there with dead little girls trapped under the ice. The scariest psychotic episode I ever had was when I was 24, shortly after watching American Horror Story: Asylum. I began hallucinating the character Bloody Face in my house and as a result slept with a butcher knife under my pillow. Additionally, I have had episodes of command hallucinations telling me to kill myself, my cat, my grandmother, and when I was a nanny, the children I cared for. I also frequently feel that I am under surveillance and think that other people are having negative thoughts and criticisms of me and my actions. I was in residential treatment as a teenager and have been hospitalized four times as an adult, most recently in 2015.

I started taking antipsychotics and mood stabilizers when I was 18, but continued to struggle with positive symptoms, mood instability, and negative symptoms, the latter of which I still have a lot of trouble with. I have significant issues with ADL's, it's an ongoing problem for me to shower regularly, brush my teeth, and remember to eat and take my meds at regular intervals. However, I manage to work a full time job in healthcare and I am a full time student with a 4.0. My positive symptoms are largely under control, though I do hear music much of the time and I see shadow people.I had a long psychotic episode set off by puberty. It wasn't until a few years into adulthood that I came down from that and could recognize that something was wrong with me in that respect.Not real schizophrenia but I got to be a part of a simulation that was similar to it. They gave us iPods with ear buds that pumped voices that had been verified to be similar (obviously nothing is exact as its a simulation) with those that people with  schizophrenia hear. They then had us do class work while getting ridiculed by acting students on why we weren't able to do simple tasks. Only did it for 40 minutes and I don't think I'd do it again if I had the chance. Really opened my eyes on what that kind of shit can be like.I was diagnosed with general psychosis, but having schizophrenic tendencies, meaning I showed some signs of it but not enough for a complete diagnosis (although I definitely hit enough markers to be called psychotic). My biggest thing was extreme paranoia, convinced I was being watched, my thoughts were being read. Then I got hit with a super bad bout of depression and started having auditory hallucinations about a month into that. But that was as far as it went, and as the depression got better so did it. No hallucinations and almost no paranoia. Thie thread is harrowing. This thread convinced me mom has undiagnosed shizophrenia becuase of her paranoid delusions but I don't know what to do or how to help her. She doesnt beleive there is anything wrong with the way she thinks and is highly untrusting of strangers so I'm worried a doctor wouldn't  be able to help, even if we convinced  her to see one in the first place. I dont know what to do I just love her so much and want to help her.[deleted]Kind of related, but I️ actually have a question to ask. Every time I️ smoked weed, I️ heard these voices or a constant hum of some random noise around me. It got bad to the point where I’d hear whispers all around me, never able to distinguish what they were saying, but it scared the shit out of me. Naturally, I️ stopped smoking soon thereafter. My question is, could that have been an early sign of schizophrenia? Thankfully, the signs didn’t continue after I️ stopped smoking, but I’ve heard that auditory hallucinations like the ones I’d experienced while high sometimes happen to people who are already at-risk for having schizophrenia. Sorry if this sounds like a webmd question, but I’m genuinely curious if anyone out there has an input on this. Thank you. Wow so I guess the weirdest thing that makes me think " I think I'm getting sick" was when I was in senior year of high school, western civ class. I was ignoring the teacher and writing in my notebook about how I liked this girl and my hand started writing on its own "Why don't you just try talking to her". Since then I have had like thoughts in my head and a spirit that can kind of talk to me move through me. It's not exactly what I thought would happen with my life but fuck I think I'm more in tune with my soul now so see the good in it. First time I noticed I was walking to a friends car and it was full of people. I went to drivers window and asked what was up and was told to get in. I asked where, the car was full of people. He said no one was in the car and when I looked again it was just him.

After that I would hear voices that sounded like someone was in another room. I felt like I kept hearing my name and thought I was home alone. I went to check and when I found no one decided it must be the neighboring apartment.

Then with friends I'd feel like I heard them talking about me when I would leave the room or even look away. When I looked at them and saw their mouths weren't moving it would stop.

Those are all most memorable things. I try to keep to myself and work alone because of it. I spend most of my time with my cat.Most of mine were based solely around the times that I was doing drugs. After years popping pain pills in high school, I was forced to quit them for probation for a while, and every now and then would see something race by real quick out of the corner of my eye. May have been withdrawal, idk. The only other time was when I was diagnosed, many years later after using more drugs, and harder drugs, my life came down on me when I woke up in county not knowing at the time how I got there, spending my short days in fear while I was awake, and spending long nights fully hallucinating in dream realities. Not fun. That's when I was diagnosed, but since I've been off drugs, I've had no problems at all, so I'm not sure how much of it was drug induced, or a misdiagnosis caused by what I was on at the time.When I lost most of my friends due to my delusions. I became very socially isolated. I began to believe people were all plotting against me. This went on for 2 years before I finally recently started seeking treatment and trying meds.[deleted]I am Schizoaffective (depressive type). My worst and most common symptom is paranoia though I do have a lot of tactile hallucinations. Fingers touching me all over or bugs crawling on my skin. 

I describe my paranoia as "being in a horror movie at all times." Everything feels threatening even a blank wall. The worst thing for me is someone nervously giggling while I am talking to them despite logic and experience telling me otherwise it puts me in fight or flight mode and I have to physically calm myself down or I'll start breaking things out of anger and fear. It started with the delusion that people can hear my thoughts and it makes you feel like you are always naked and people can see through your every intention. I have never attacked a person just broken objects, like I ripped my bedroom door off the wall because of a delusion that someone put a trap on it.

I am a 6'2" 300lbs large framed man and I started having schizophrenic symptoms when I was 16, when I went to the hospital the first time my doctor(s) put me on a super strong cocktail of drugs because they were afraid of my size/strength and what I might do and the drugs really messed me up over the years.

Mentally ill people like me seem threatening at our worst times but it is not really the true 'us'. I would describe myself as a big kind teddy-bear 98% of the time, but when I get an episode I might seem scary but if someone I trust just sits and listens to my troubles I can go back to my usual teddy-bear self.https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1xdzzi/redditors_with_schizophrenia_looking_back_what/Not sure how much I count. I've never been diagnosed, and for all I know this is perfectly normal, but I'm too scared to ask a doctor.

Every time I smoke weed, I panic. The more I consume, the worse the anxiety gets. I've also noticed that the more high I get, the more likely I hear things.

The first time I noticed something was in college. My friends and I went to a convention, and they brought some pot brownies and we each ate a quarter about a half hour before a panel for Adventure Time started. The panel was gonna show an episode that hadn't aired yet, and so we were super excited. I distinctly remember the rise and fall of my joy for the panel. That was a distinct "Hahaha, this is so much fun! I love this" And followed by a distinct "I need to get out of here, please, someone, please get me out of this room." I got really claustrophobic and I felt like I couldn't breathe. My friends ended up walking me out of the convention and I hung out outside shaking, drinking water. My friends convinced me I had a bad high and that these things can happen.

The second time I tried weed was in college. We smoked from a blunt(no biggie, I smoked cigs at the time.) And everything like, turned gray, and was terrifying for some reason. The sounds of my friends laughing was horrifying, which only made them laugh more. "haha, check it out, Tanner's freaking out, man. Dude you just gotta mellow out bro." At some point someone started to approach me and I started freaking out and yelling at them and so they decided it wasn't funny anymore and the party transitioned from "Let's have fun" to "Let's help Tanner." I felt really bad because I felt like everything was all focused on me and I was bumming the vibes of everyone else.

The third and final time I remember was this time at a party my friends were like "Let's get you as high as possible" to which my drunk ass said "Yes let's!" (I am not a wise man.) I ended up throwing up in a bathroom and hearing sounds. Like whispers or crying/sobbing. (No, the whispers did not say anything.) My girlfriend at the time had to drive me home. I swear I thought I was hearing my girlfriend cry in the car on the way home, like she was disappointed in me, but I'd ask "honey, are you okay?" and the crying would stop suddenly and she'd say "Nothing?" And clearly, she was not crying, but moments later, I'd hear it again; sobbing! I'd ask "Are you sure you're not crying?" and she followed with "Yes, I'm sure." in a confused, annoyed tone which told me I was straight up hearing things. When I told her what had happened, along with previous times I'd smoked, she very sternly told me I'm not allowed to smoke weed anymore. 

Since then, I haven't. From time to time, I'll be at a party and I'll take one hit off a pipe thinking maybe "this is the time I won't freak out." and even the littlest hit will send me into anxiety. I'm not sure if the anxiety is from me freaking out about being anxious, or if it's biological, but after that one time I heard whispers and crying I decided it was for the best to never get "as high as possible" *ever* again.

Edit: By the way, if anyone even reads this, if you've heard of this, could you be so kind as to tell me if this is normal or not? I've looked into it and apparently there's a whole debate about it but no proof to a link and so I dunno what any of it means and I'm not about to schedule a ton of doctors appointments and hundreds of dollars to have a doctor just say "Yeah don't get high."Scratching noises and knocking sounds in my head. I always think someones at the door, or trying to get my attention. That and like pairs of hands that sit behind me while I am standing. Like, the left and right hands of someone are near my waist until I turn around. It's odd.As a kid, I would always hear people calling my name or asking me to do unpleasant things, even when no one else was around.

They always presented as people I knew, including my own mother.

Despite this, my concerns were not taken seriously until just a few years ago when I was finally diagnosed.Paranoid Schizophrenic here.

When I was 19 and smoking weed with my friends, I started experiencing catatonia. Basically I couldn't move or react to what people were saying around me, and I began heating voices talking to me. The voices we're horrible. Not demons or anything like that. For me the voices always belonged to the people around me, they would constantly critique me, tell me to kill myself, tell me to fuck off, etc, etc. 

I had already known my grandma was a Schizophrenic, so I was already on alert if these issues started appearing. At first I thought my friends were legit fucking with me because I kept freezing up whenever I smoked, but thank god I realized nope I'm beginning to suffer from psychosis. Went to the hospital got diagnosed etc. etc.

I'm fine now even though I don't take the antipsychotics. They pretty much turn you into a zombie and cause you to gain a shit ton of weight. I rarely hear voices anymore but if I do I'm able to discern if they're actually real.  



Well I had a slow progression into hearing voices. My diagnosis started out with me being extremely paranoid and thinking that my mom had people following me. that lead to uncontrollable crying. Then after months of walking around thinking people were following me I heard a voice when I was leaving home to get my hair done. I thought my mom said something to me but she didnt. I went to the salon and I heard the voices saying all these mean things about me. Then I left I i continued to hear voices. So i went to church because I thought that it was a "gift" from God. I think was under the impression i could hear peoples thoughts. I was still in denial a while. I don't even really remember telling anyone I was hearing voices...I just know I ended up going to the hospital after a while. But since I was delusional and I believed that people were actually following me I knew something was really wrong once I started crying uncontrollably.As a child I couldn’t go to bed without saying good night to the cameras in each corner of my room. I thought this was normal. I spent my 20s self medicating so most everything I chalked ipnto being drunk and crazy. It wasn’t til I moved to an island and decided to start over and got sober for a while I realized that I still had the dissociative parts I thought were blackout related. I went to a doctor and got on meds and it became more clear I had suffered this all my life. I’m medicated and in a good spot now.When I discovered that all my friends were imaginary.When I was at work, sometimes I'd go outside and everything would look a little too sharp...almost pixelated, like I was in a videogames. Then, I stared feeling like people were following me around outside. And I took more notice of the posters that were stuck up at the mailbox station. They seemed to be in code. And I was plagued by coincidences. Soon, there were so many odd happenings, I began to feel fenced in by them.I can't quite remember what age I was but as early as the 4th grade, I remember shadows taking form.

For example the shadow cast on the wall by the chair, first I would see the shadow on the left, then later I would see it on the right and wonder if the chair had moved? it hadn't. i was there the entire time. Then I would just look at it - kinda like that [little kid in the Matrix that bends the spoon](https://mikecalimbas.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/spoon.jpg) and I could make the shadow go from left to right - although slowly. I was convinced I could move things if I tried hard enough, but first the shadow would move and then the chair. I did move things, I know I had, but my parents and siblings never believed me, so I stopped trying.

Over the years it has affected my concentration and my memory has always been for shit. I forget people I know. Places I have lived. Jobs I have had.

It's gotten worse with the separation from my wife of 15 years. I suffered a nervous breakdown several months ago. I went for a walk, blanked out, was found in a neighboring town, 15 miles away, delirious :( couldn't answer any questions from the paramedics, rushed to the ER where EKG was done and blood drawn, chest x-ray (because I was complaining of chest pain) and a cat scan. Nothing was found wrong with me. I was released to the care of my roommate/slash/brother.

I recently made a post that my Dr thinks a therapy pet would be good for me and I will be getting the paperwork for that finalized this week and hopefully heading to the rescue shelter the following week.I remember as a child (like elementary school age) trying to have a conversation with someone across from me in my head or tell them to do something so that I knew they could hear.  Then when they wouldn't respond I'd just assume they're being a dick.

Later on the paranoia started.  I could NOT sleep as a child.  I would be terrified that someone would come in while I was sleeping and stab me to death.  Every night.  As a very young child.  For a VERY long time and it sometimes still does get to me.

I also remember a pretty long overlapping period where I felt like I was being watched and plotted against, all the time, by everyone.  Like The Truman Show except the whole point is to see how far everyone can push me until they all get to watch me hang myself.

After long enough I started hearing people that weren't there.  Though I could tell that part wasn't real.  I knew no one was there and what I was hearing wasn't bad anyway.  It would be whoever's voice is closest to me and would be reassuring, telling me everything will be okay, that I'm not alone.  I'd touch my own face and it would feel like it was them and everything was okay.  I knew it wasn't, but I didn't feel so alone.

That still continues.  I still hear whoever is closest to me (consistently my girlfriend for the last three years and she knows), I still touch my own face.  Though there are rare periods where I think I might get stabbed in my sleep one night and less frequent than that there are times where my life feels like a cruel The Truman Show again.  Like when I was a child.

But mostly just the comforting voice.

-----

So I guess to answer: I knew when I was very young that the voices weren't real, but the paranoia was VERY real to me and made me into a very scared child who never left his house.

EDIT: Updated first part for clarity.For me it's the voices telling me people are plotting against me... Well at least two of the voices are. The 3rd one tries to talk me down. 

I'll have arguments in my head that people will tell me never really happened, but they are completely real for me. I was just 100% diagnosed last week by the way, before that they weren't 109% sure, they thought I was just paranoid. But after my recent hospitalization they changed my diagnosis. Hallucinations: When I started seeing this crazy humanoid figures EVERYWHERE. I thought it was my mind playing tricks on me so I just tried to ignore it but, usually when ur mind is playing tricks on u, whatever u saw goes away when u look back, WELL NOT FOR ME! 

Audio: all my life I’ve always heard screaming in my head but most of the time it sounds external. Usually it’s incoherent gibberish, angery screaming, or screaming voices saying my name over and over and over again. More recently, I hear like, anything when there’s really nothing. Door bells, faucets, radio/tv, sirens, walking/running, tha list goes on.

Paranoia: about 2 years ago, I began getting more paranoid than common paranoia. For example: I always feel like a sniper is aiming for me or like whenever I’m in a populated area, I’m gonna get gunned down any second; I always feel like I’m being watch through tiny cameras everywhere(in door hinges, in outlets, in air vents, etc); I feel like I’m being chased everywhere I go, i feel as if ‘everyone’ is plotting against me, and the list goes on(again). The worst part is that I can n e v e r shake the feeling. I just live my life in fear. My mom doesn’t want me to be medicated :(((

There’s so much other things and it’s hell. But all I can do is make light of it by laughing at myself🤷‍♀️

Like once, my friends dropped me off kinda far from my house and as soon as I it out, he ripped off, so in my mind I’m like “wtf was that about??,....wait....he’s maybE RUNNING FROM SOMETHING!!  QUICK TURN AROUND!!!” So I look and i see this HUGE GRIZZLY BEAR running down the street towards me, so here I am running home in platform boots looking ridiculous. Let me remind u, I live in the urban-suburb part of ga, where the biggest animals we have are deer 😅I had enough voices pressuring me that I felt like hurting myself, my parents took note and called the authorities which landed me in the hospital where I was diagnosed, the voices can be pretty demanding and it can become difficult when you're living multiple livesThese are making me feel like I might have symptoms.. I mean my cousin has it, my dads side is kind of fucked up.  I had a schizophrenic episode once but I was doing some weird drugs at the time 

I was hearing music in places and thought my landlord was fucking with me. I tore a bunch of wall out looking for wires and shit.  It was so trippy because the music was just inside a few rooms and only once I was in the room. It was the most boiler plate dubstep base beat over and over and over again.

I don't want to think about the other things that I share in common with these replies. I know I'm the most paranoid mf'er in my circle so idk. Maybe It's just my brain damage playing tricks on meI was going to kill myself then I heard them say I didn't deserve to die until I atoned for what I did. I kept asking people if they saw the strange figures in the shadows and if they heard that person talking saying things, but no one else did. The kicker was when I couldn't sleep for 5 days (108 hrs) because I was convinced that my wall was oozing shit from another reality and people would come through and hurt me if I let down my guard.All my life, I can't remember a time when I didn't hear voices or see stuff. Whenever I said something to my parents they thought I could talk to ghosts and told me I had a gift, fucking hippies. I did not quite believe them but they refused to take me to a doctor (and don't come and fucking say that a 7 year old should book an appointment by herself).

It escalated when I was 21 which ended in the mental ward for me and 3 years unemployment while I was tending to myself. Alone of course because my parents still believe I talk to ghosts.

Had I gotten help when I was young I do think life would have been a smidge easier during my childhood.I am at present diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder but following my first psychotic break I was diagnosed undifferentiated schizophrenic.

I began to notice my mind was not right. I had been trying to develop control over the smoke drifting up from a stick of incense. I also tried dangling my necklace chain from my hand and trying to control it with my mind. I tried listening to a bird singing, thinking about Adam in the garden of Eden, imagining that if I concentrated enough I could decipher and understand what it was saying.

 I was getting further and further from normal thinking. I had picked up a piece of stepped on paper that I thought looked like a bird, and took it home as if it had talismanic significance. I had met two men passing through campus who talked to me about Jesus, and I became certain they were two of Christ's original disciples. 

I had been smoking pot weekly since about a year previous to all of this, but even two or three years previous I had become deeply interested in abstract thinking and kept trying to engage my friends in philosophic discussions, after which several of them told me, "you think too much."

In order to try on different philosophies I imagined what it would be like to keep a version of my mind with my present Christian beliefs and another version with say Buddhist thoughts, and in my spare moments reflect on how things would have taken place differently had my beliefs been different. I did this on a relatively permanent basis for about three years before my breakdown, as a thinking habit, a sort of extended thought experiment. Whenever I had evaluated the philosophy I wanted to try on and decided against adopting it, I reset and started over with a new fresh trying room. That's how I thought of it. Sort of compartmentalized my thinking. I would keep silent about what I was entertaining in the trying room and not act on it, just keep track.

I don't recommend this, by the way.

As I grew closer to my breakdown, I kept an increasingly different version of reality in my hypothetical trying room. The strain between the two was becoming intense. I was essentially living with two radically different versions of reality inside, one of which was secret and walled off.

I had been becoming troubled by this. I had befriended someone I didn't like at all, named Ben. I had been attending a Bible study at college and a friend from Bible study, a girl, asked me if I would talk to this atheist. He was extremely hostile to religion. He treated everyone else as if they were stupid if they weren't atheist. He introduced himself to people like this. "Hi, I'm Ben, and I'm arrogant." With a smile. He self-described as a hedonist. Melodic apostasy was a phrase he coined and was quite happy with. He was the worst person I knew, but I was going to Save him.

After all this time going on like this, I was becoming desperate. I wanted to reset my brain. Ben told me he had done LSD with some friends and wanted me to trip with him. He had little bits of paper in a container, triangles. I don't know if it was really LSD. But I tried it. I believed it. I think for him it might have been a prank. Or an experiment. To him I was a plaything.

Anyway, I "tripped" with him. I believed the strictures which held my mind were loosed. But things didn't improve. I felt beaten.

I went to another person, one who I judged to be smarter than Ben, to take him on in a way, to do acid with me. I couldn't fight the battle I was in. Crazy way to think, I know. This time it was real LSD for sure.

Due to the contents of our trip, I became focused on demons and spiritual warfare. I thought I'd seen him showing me a demon inside him.

Anyway, the trips went on as I grasped at the straws of my fleeting sanity.

What came first, the drugs or the psychosis?

At any rate, I was just finished with my second year of college and one and a half years into my break when I was prepared to commit suicide. My life was hell inside, complete with mental anguish and torment, with the devil and demons. I couldn't even hear speech without trying to decipher a second meaning spoken by forked tongues. I believed I was damned.

Thankfully, I went to the doctor about my depression after Zoloft had failed to make it better. I felt like being lifted up against a steel plate that was crushing me down. My normal doctor wasn't there that day, and his partner asked me if I'd done drugs. I said yes. He asked which ones. I told him, pot, shrooms, and acid.

He asked me if he could tell my mom, who had brought me there. I said yes. 

Which is why I'm still alive.

She brought me straight from the doctor to the hospital where she worked, and the ER took me in with acute LSD-induced psychosis. I was admitted. I was in the psych ward.

I stayed 21 days, and didn't want to leave.

I've been medicated ever since, except for a three month period after two separate psychiatrists and my counselor decided I was not schizophrenic after all and didn't need medication. 

When I went off my meds, I felt wonderful! I lost a ton of weight. I went from a 34 inch waist to a 32. My mood was wonderful. I felt alive!

Then three months later, I had a night where everything fell apart. I ended up back in the psych ward, over ten years later.

That was seven years ago. I'm still stable, still medicated, only now my diagnosis is schizoaffective disorder. My doctor said it was possible I was bipolar, as the two diagnoses are similar. So he essentially asked me which of the two it felt like I had.

The treatment is about the same. I'm now a size 36. I weigh 205. I take several medicines, two to deal with high blood pressure and high triglycerides and fatty liver, side effects of my psych meds. I only work 20 hours a week.

I hadn't intended to write so much. If anyone has any questions I'm happy to answer. I just hope no one I know figures out this is me.

Edit: I just remembered this. In the ER there was this really sweet young girl, and I was so afraid my insanity was contagious. I was so afraid I was going to infect her. I begged and pleaded with God to protect her from me. All silently as I tried to smile back. I must have looked so scared.

I just remembered more. The paper bird was a message from God that had come from around the world. My sins went as far from me as east is from West, and came back around in a form unrecognizable except to me. The signs were all around me.

The TV in the waiting room, the commercials were referring to me.[removed]Damn too many replies that mine about Schizoaffective disorder won’t get seen. So TL;DR multiple diagnoses suckkkkWas at home sick for around 2 months and I always did hear some voices but this one day I had a full 15 minutes conversation with my "mom" and then I remembered she was at work all that time I’m wondering lately if I am schizophrenic because for the longest time I have been extremely paranoid that my life is like the Truman show and everyone is watching me and recording me and pretending to be my friends and family. I get freaked out that people know when I lie or what I was saying or doing while I was alone. I get worried people are laughing at me or talking about me all the time. I worry all my friends only hangout with me because they feel bad for me. There’s a lot. I am diagnosed with GAD (generalized anxiety disorder) and I am not currently medicated for it. My boyfriend is a high-functioning diagnosed schizophrenic. He’s got his under control it seems (sometimes I wonder if he even has it anymore)... for some reason his diagnosis makes it hard for me to ask him if he hears the beeping every 3-5 minutes, or the sound of the shower turning on, or if he heard that child laughing. It’s especially hard to stay in control when the lady in white jumps in front of our car. I don’t drive anymore. Almost never leave home and definitely not by myself. I long for walks with nature, exploring the world like I always wanted to. I just fucking can’t.In high school my friends and family noticed I would react to sounds, voices, and interact with things that weren't there. I was diagnosed with schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder. Both of these coupled with dissociative amnesia, and the anxiety and depression they produce has led to some scary situations. The worst by far was about six months ago. The voices woke me up screaming at me that someone was coming after me. I sat up in bed and turned on my lamp. Laying in the centre of my room was the mangled body of the coyote I had hit in my truck three months prior. It was dragging its broken body towards me and was trying to crawl on my bed. I yelled for my parents and when my dad opened the door, dozens of dead bloated corpses fell into my room. They were all screaming and moaning and the smell was unimaginable. I don't remember much after that. I know that the police came, transported me to the mental ward at the hospital where I spent a few horrifying days while the doctors sorted out my meds. Mental illness is some scary shit. This isn’t my experience, but my moms. My mom is my best friend, and I’m very close to her.
Anyway, her first time realizing something wasn’t ‘right’ was right after my younger sister was born. My mom was around 25 and she started to talk about seeing our neighbors peeping into her room late at night. my grandma investigated this, and realized it wasn’t actually happening. 
My mom has told me that at the beginning, reality and hallucinations were hard to distinguish, but now it’s much easier for her. Her hallucinations are almost completely audial now. She often thinks things are conspiring against her, or looks very deeply into things that seem meaningless to someone on the outside. An example of this was back a few years ago, our microwave broke. Apparently before my grandma died (10 years ago) the microwave broke. My mom cried for hours because she thought these things were connected, and someone was going to die soon. My then ex- boyfriend texted me one day that I don't have to cook and he is buying a kebab for me. And that my son is with him and they are having a great time together. Well. My 4yo son was with me in my kitchen. We had a  long distance relationship before and lived 120km apart. We were after break-up for 5 months. I realized something is wrong. I called him but he didn't answer. 3 hours later I get a message from the hospital that the patient is ok and they texted me because I was the last one talking to him in his phone. They found out he had schizophrenia.I teach a teenaged schizophrenic. They are from a country that has a belief in nature spirits and people having an ability to talk to ancestors. This young person believes themselves to be a bridge between the spirit world and the human world. 

All their auditory hallucination to them are helpful. Like a good guy hallucination. Ghosts speak but they offer advice and make predictions. 

It's a very interesting case. Right now the parents and doctors are monitoring the situation. Seeing it this becomes a serious hindrance or not.  I always assumed i just had weird thoughts and extreme anxiety/depression until reading some of the replies on here. I have always given personalities to numbers letter and cars. Like to me a 6 is closely related to a dodge truck and he's strong and rugged he has a certain face and attitude.  The letter E is shy and is close to the number 5. I also have a constant fear of someone following me he's behind me. He's in my house. He's watching in the corner of the room. I will have full on melt downs thinking he is about to murder me. As a young child i would convince myself a lump of clothing was a monster head then i would actively see it moving around I remember vividly these memories. Putting it off as just weird kid things .  My grandma is diagnosed with schizophrenia and my brother has been diagnosed with bi polar disorder. I'm probably just a weird anxiety mess but I would like to hear some other people's opinion on my situation It kinda slips up slowly. The problem with being "crazy" is that too your brain it's perfect logic. While yes it should be untrue that the house is bugged, how else do you explain the fact she knew you wanted tuna fish. ( actual example)
Imagine if one day you did the math and 1+1=3 
And even though you knew it was wrong, no matter how many times you did the calculations you always got to 3. When I KNEW they were going to kill me, but I knew I wasn’t THAT crazy. Literally I’d be hearing a fishing story and in the same moment instead of poles they were shotguns... instead of joyful memories being passed, they were murderous plans against me. It was humbling to realize that my emotional understanding had taken more prevalence than the actual moment. I still fight it today. And it’s HARD.I do wonder,  have someone with Schizophrenia played Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice ? 

How similar is it to real schizophrenia as this game terrified me to hell.
While not hearing other voices , my own voice/mind wonders to the most random things .

Its as if my own voice is like the dozens of different voices inside the game and keep giving me different suggestions non stop .To all the people with schizophrenia - what can I do about my sister, who was diagnosed with one but refuses to accept that? Because of that, she lost a year of her life already, staying in home and pretending like there's no problem. I was in Amsterdam doing my internship, then one day I had a fight with my roommate and didn't go to the office. I was roaming around in the streets when I heard my employers name. I thought they were following me. Same happened the next day, when I saw people from my office there. I heard stories of events from my office from random people on the streets. I left the city but the voices kept following me. I thought people were following my actions, my thoughts, I thought cameras were reading me. I left the country and came to India, where it still followed me. I thought they were playing some kind of a joke with me but I wanted it to end but it didn't. 6 months later I decided to go to the psychiatrist only to tell me that I'm schizophrenic. But I can still swear that some people were actually following my actions. Dunno what's real.My doctors told me that schizophrenia is becoming an outdated diagnosis. I do have BPD1 with psychotic features and many of the experiences here are the same as my own. 

I think the earliest example I remember was that I hear music. Not like a song stuck in your head but as if a radio is playing. Except I hear multiple radios sometimes, playing over each other or syncing up and it is incredibly annoying and distracting. 

I didn't piece together my hallucinations until high school. I didn't realise anything was wrong. I just thought it was all normal. I've talked to people who I could see and discovered they were not there. I've heard sounds and voices. I've felt touch on my skin and seen myself standing in another place when I am out in public; once time, trying to get to work, I was suddenly in an airport. It was so real that I called in and went the fuck home. Another similar occasion was at my desk at work. I looked up to find myself on a beautiful, empty beach. Looked down at the desk. Looked back up at the beach. Back down again and my desk was gone and I was standing. A calm fell over me and all was at peace even as I thought in wonder, "this isn't right. I'm at work right now." I don't know how much time passed but eventually I looked down and was at my desk again, still seated. 

Also the comments about always assuming there to be a camera or someone/something watching applies STRONGLY to me. Schizophrenia is a nasty disease...  it's the one disease that convinces you that you dont have it and everyone else is wrong.  I knew this one guy that swore he didnt have it but that russia and nato were downloading thoughts into his brain with peoples prayers.  Scary shit.That's the thing - you don't notice things aren't right. 

All through highschool on and off I though my friends were paid by my parents just to be my friends and they were recording my conversations.

I thought my parents were listening to me or reading the transcripts. 

I never once thought to tell anyone. It just becomes reality. Yes! Always someone watching. My life felt like the Truman show. I saw alot of shadow people. Heard my name being called and could hear music, mostly heavy metal when I would run water. I i thought people could read my mind and was generally paranoid I was part of some psy op. Everyone was part of some operation and knew eachother. No one would fess up to it. My first real realization I was having a schizophrenic episode was at a hospital. It terrified me and I left in only a pair of jeans and a hospital gown and walked across the city barefoot. I thought everyone was video recording me and they were all conspiring with the hospital and police. I hid in my friends basement for a day or so. Found out later that day my friend Kyle hung himself and I bugged out thinking this was another ploy to get me out of hiding. I've got things under control now but it's genuinely hard to decide of I was delusional or if I was on to something, like a glitch in the matrix...I have Schizoaffective Disorder. Simply put, it's a combination of schizophrenia and bipolar. So no, not quite schizophrenia, but I do feel that it still fits here. 

I started noticing that things weren't quite right when the spice girls on my spice girls poster starting moving their mouths without any sound coming out. I thought nothing of it at first, until other hallucinations (like moths) started appearing. My brother began covering the tv with a towel and believing that the neighbors van was spying on him. He also believed our mom and dad were replaced by other people who were wearing dogs to look like our mom and dad. He also stopped eating because he believed these imposters were trying to poison him. He also had those crazy eyes that people talk about when the are dark and stare through you. Sad story. He's been on and off meds but is doing pretty well today.I sought psychiatric help in my early thirties when i started experiencing drastic visual hallucinations that put me at risk of injuring myself. The easiest way of describing it would be that my brain had changed channel from what i was seeing to something else entirely, but i was unaware of it until it changed back to what was actually in front of me. These "channel changes" could last from a few seconds to almost half an hour. 

It's harder to answer when the first "not quite right" symptom was, because no one can know what actually happens in their head relative to everyone else, and it's difficult to describe to people.

I distinctly remember discovering hearing my internal monologue for the first time when i was six and it immediately telling me not to tell anyone i could hear it. I've been hearing it ever since, sometimes it's helpful and other times it tries to get me hurt. Is that normal? I avoid totally quiet environments because if there is not a level of background noise the voice morphs into a torturous cacophony of noise, think the Monolith noise from 2001 but up to 11.

When having a discussion about this "disturbing thoughts" came up, violent graphic unbidden images suddenly popping into your head. I don't consider that as applying to me since i've had sudden thoughts of graphic murder about almost everyone since i can remember, so they are not "disturbing" to me.

I mostly have a handle on things now though, the worst i get are illusory spiders in my peripheral vision, but spiders are cool, so I'm happy with it.For what it's worth: I began going through spells where everything became super "clear" visually and it would suddenly feel like everything was completely fake - almost like I suddenly remembered that I'm on a stage and caught a glimpse of the audience through the lights. It would last about 30 seconds before I sort of "came to". It got worse and worse where I started hearing voices and found that I couldn't move at all until it was over. The fact that I was hearing voices scared me the most and I thought for sure that I must have some kind of schizophrenia.

*Then*, suddenly one night I had a Grand Mal seizure and the doctors discovered that what I was experiencing before were just smaller seizures. After I got on my seizure meds everything went completely back to normal. I got diagnosed but I don't believe I have it , There was a tomboyish teacher as our instructor and Im thinking of funny comments inside my head. Somebody laughed out loud. The teacher even said to a few students in a low voice that she cant do anything but shut up. That's when I realized everyone can hear me. Thought broadcasting is my disease. Probably when the walls started bleeding profusely.I'm not schizophrenic (at least in the sense of a disorder meaning it has some negative impacts on my life). My hallucinations are very rare and, while being a little confusing, don't disturb or upset me. Maybe it's a normal thing, I'm not sure. What does strike me is just how real they seem when they do happen.

The common factor is always lack of sleep and jet lag from traveling. I don't have them otherwise. One time I was on a long international flight and couldn't sleep. I think I had flipped through the music selection and gone by a Sinatra album. About 10 minutes later I started hallucinating "Fly me to the Moon" in background of the loud noise of the airplane. It started off very quite, I thought it was playing through someone's head phones in the row in front of me, but it kept getting louder, up to the point where it was like I was listening to it myself with headphones. It's seemed impossibly real. The song started to deviate from the normal recording, it turned into this sort of heavier blues song with trumpet solos and saxophones and full brass section really whaling at it behind Sinatra. In the last chorus, in between the part where Sinatra sings "in other words, I love you" there was a long drum solo into the final trash can ending from the band.

Every single note, the entire band, Sinatra's voice, all seemed so fucking real and loud and present. But I knew the whole time it wasn't really there. One of the more bizarre things I've ever experienced.

I've had something like this only three times I can think of. Always on jet lag, always auditory hallucinations.General question here: Why are all the hallucinations about evil stuff, bad persons, voices telling you to kill/hurt/burn ? 

Is there a scientific reason, like it affects a specific part of the brain or something ?

Why isn't there schizophrenic episodes where a nice grandma tells you how to cure cancer or a cool unicorn that whispers compliments in your ear ?I know every person is different, but it seems meds worked on most people in this thread.  My question to them is, how long did it take to find the right med/dosage and for it to work? How many different meds did you have to try?  I have a son w/ some issues and we've been through a million meds and dosages and still trying to fine tune his depression issues.Voices calling my name was the first. I kept thinking it was just my parents or friends calling from a distance untell I would hear it when I was completely alone.Before I lost insight, I told people that either someone was messing with me in an elaborate practical joke involving the selection of songs on the radio relating to what I was doing at any given time, or I was losing my mind (I said this jokingly, never thinking for a second that something so unthinkable could be happening). I just thought something weird was happening, like it was some fluke. I didn’t pay much attention to it. 

Anyway, I regained insight thanks to the kindness of strangers, medical professionals, and medication. I’ve been symptom-free for years now. Just wondering, when is the line crossed between schizophrenia and anxiety? Like right now I know I have anxiety and it makes me worry that people are always talking behind my back and don't really like me. It doesn't help that I see people doing this and it makes me worry it really is happening and thats why I can't get ahead among other things.

That being said, I don't have any really crazy paranoid thoughts like people poisoning my food or the FBI watching me or anything like that. Its all just social stuff. Sure sometimes I get a little crazy in stressful situations (like at work I sent a text calling my employer an asshole because I didn't get a certain day off. No one saw, but for a little while I was worried they saw it or could monitor texts between me and my fiancee and then bam i'm fired and out on the streets)

I guess I just want to know what's the line? Is it the craziness of the thoughts? I don't hallucinate or anything though I do have some strange tendencies like worrying about ghosts at night (I will cover my head and sleep on my stomach so I can't see. I know there's nothing there more than likely but I still have that fear. I also hate sleeping next to windows without the blinds or curtains closed at night.)

I'm pretty sure I don't have schizophernia but I worry. Hell my high school principal assumed that this was the case when I was being bullied (or at least that's what it sounded like to me. He said I might be making it up.) And maybe there is some sort of link.

But probably its just my anxiety being kicked into overdrive by this thread.Diagnosed schizoaffective. Early onset here, and currently almost totally in remission (yay!)

I can actually look back and see the signs in early childhood. Remembering when I was a kid and my mom was convinced I just had an "imaginary friend," and then couldn't understand why I was always scared and freaking out when I saw it, because I couldn't properly describe it... having to go sleep in her bed multiple times because there were "tons of maggots" in mine. I had a recurring idea (despite a very secular upbringing) that God was punishing me for various things, often totally outside of my control. 

I tried to talk to doctors about things a few times but my parents always stonewalled me, said there was nothing wrong with me except I was sensitive. I think I figured out something was genuinely and truly "off" in my teens while I was checking behind the paintings for recording devices. Something just felt weird about doing it, but I didn't get help then either, because I was totally enmeshed in my weird lifestyle. Didn't get help when I had to leave public events with my then-GF because I heard screaming everywhere. Didn't get help when Satan was talking to me 24/7. Didn't get help when I dropped out because my hallucinations were disrupting my time at school so badly. 

I saw my first therapist at age 21 when I had a blowout with some friends online. I'd gone weird again, and accused them all of trying to steal my identity and absorb pieces of my soul or something, then when I calmed down from it I decided I needed to see a psych. Not because of the constant hearing voices or visual hallucinations, just because I was being mean to my friends and didn't want it to keep happening. I've heard similar things from a lot of people - we get help because of a relatively minor quality of life issue, not because we're always aware we're delusional. Has anyone else experienced smells that no one else can smell? It's reoccurring and doesn't just happen in one place. A lot of times I will smell cinnamon much similar to the scented broomstick they sell around the holidays. It's like a red hot is shoved right up my nostril. I smell it at home, the grocery store, in the car etc. And nobody else can smell it. A new one lately is I smell a very strong perfume that I can only describe as a church going grandmother. I only smell it in the appartment, the roomates can't smell it. I've tried sniffing random things around the house to see if I could possibly be smelling something else; laundry soap, arisol air fresheners, even tried sniffing the vents to see if a neighbors smell wafted in. It is such a strong smell it's nauseating, but again, only I smell it. Some of these responses are bone chillingThis will probably be ignored and be not much good use to anyone. Some may even think I'm an asshole for saying this... but I believe it needs saying. After reading this thread I realized either A. I'm schizophrenic or B. People are resorting to drugs to deal with spiritual problems. 
I'm not saying the voices are real, but I think that there's extreme similarities between what nearly every culture and its spiritual leaders call being a shaman and essentially a person who is schizophrenic. In that, people who dive into shamanism generally have some sort of connection to the spirit world that manifests in a variety of ways. Often this can be debilitating and certainly medical attention is needed, but if it's like what many people are saying, "a tv show says what you are thinking" or "seeing people that aren't there" or "having voices talk to you" it's worth noting that culturally this phenomenon has been going on for ... ever and there have been numerous ways of dealing with it, even harnessing it for good throughout nearly every culture.
I would hope that people aren't so detached from being spiritual that they rule this options out completely, or that they think it's just as simple as demon possession and that they need to run to a priest right away. 
I'm just saying that maybe there's something more to what you're experiencing and looking back in history and at other cultures may help you with similarities you find to your own condition.

It may even help you get off pharmaceuticals if your condition isn't that bad. Which is always a plus I don't know if this counts, but after some bad experiences with edibles and weed i haven't been to sure lately. Before my mind was, i guess normal though very active as i would always have a thought on my mind no matter the situation, usually if it was a random female just picturing them naked and all the kinds, but sometimes with other people just things like how would they react if i just slapped them as hard as i could, or their reaction if i was just to say something completely random (though never do those things, i'm not insane lol), or other odd random curious thoughts. Though after my run in with psychedelics that changed drastically.

 Smoking weed my first two times was fine as i did it in moderation and nothing changed. But one day i had some edibles, and had a REALLY bad trip, where my my mind was everywhere and i was scared to think (ended up in the hospital). After that though everything was still fine as i blacked out a bunch during the trip and mostly forgot all the visions and hallucinations i had. But then when undoubtedly i made my worse ever decision in life and like 3 months after this had smoked some weed with some friends as i had before and everything was fine. Now i don't know if this was due to my mind being fragile from the trip, bad weed, or me taking about 30 hits from the bowl but i had another BAD trip (i'd say half the intensity of the edible trip as i was able to control myself and not have to end up in the hospital again). But during this trip i wasn't hallucinating or having visions, but matter in fact remembering EVERYTHING i saw and experienced during the edible trip down to the detail which scared me shitless because of the stuff i saw. To make things even worse my mind started to believe that all of those visions and hallucinations were real really fucking me up in the head.

 About a week after this id have my first ever anxiety attack in my life. This happening to a kid who NEVER stressed about anything in his life. Worse part of all of this is that it started happening as i was preparing myself to leave for college in a month. I would have constant daily thoughts that I've seen everything that was happening in front of me, that i was going to die soon, that the devil was out to get me as i wronged god, that i was for some reason just going to repeat life at some random moment and that this isn't my first time living this life. It was really stressing me that i was eating less and basically stayed in my house and room all summer (asides from a few gathers, though i was very reclusive and uncomfortable during them which my close friend who were at them noticed and helped me through the night.) At some point i had broke down in my shower and started crying as i just felt so not in control of my thoughts and felt i was literally going crazy.

 Then came the point of my college orientation which was nowhere close to home, and was an overnight. When i arrived the moment i set eyes on the door to my room of the night i had an instant panic attack (which i kept to myself and powered through the day) as on the door letters from my on of my hallucinations had matched up making me feel really unsafe. When it came to the end of the night i didn't even sleep in my assigned room as i felt so unsafe, but slept with a friend who was going to the same college as my whos roommate for the night (luckily) did not arrive. During this night though i got no sleep and had another panic attack in the bed, but kept to myself because i didn't wanna bother waking my friend who was sleeping (also on the other side of the room in pitch black darkness).

 Coming back home from the orientation me and my mom went out to eat in sort of celebration. In the restaurant though, i felt extremely uncomfortable as if everyone was watching me/out to get me or that at some point everything was going to freeze and everyone would slowly turn their heads towards me triggering some supernatural event to happen ( me dying or the restarting life thing). My mom started to notice me acting weird and asked me what was wrong as me being so uncomfortable was starting to make her (she works in the force so she thought i was watching someone watch her) At first i shakily said i was fine but i obviously wasn't and was visibly shaking. When the food came i had but only a bite as i had no appetite at all, and i guess this was the major give for her and she asked me if i wanted to just leave, and i said yes, please. So we got our food to go, and on the rest of the ride home i broke down telling her every detail of how i felt and why i was probably feeling the way (weed, though she already knew about the edible because she had to get me from the hospital where i was tripping). She responded well and talked with me, though expressing the disappointment of me smoking even after saying i was done after the edible. It honestly helped a bunch though.

 For the rest of the remaining month i would still be on edge, staying in my room though doing a little better and eating a little more. I can say though after coming up and being in and getting used to college (and turning 18) has made everything so much better. Now i eat a healthy three (maybe four lol, did this a lot before i went of the rails) everyday and have really chill room/suite/building mates that i hang with. Though my thoughts never returned to how they were before, and sometimes i still feel uncomfortable in normal everyday situations that will just send an unreasonable sense of peril down my body, i have been getting better by the day. Also every time i talk about it whether parents or friends, i feel that makes it feel so much more better for some reason. Only gripe i have is i wish the thoughts of me having seen things i know i haven't seen but absolutely feel i have or the extreme thought that my time is coming near and/or my life will reset would just leave my head as it would just make everything better.

 But yea, sorry for the wall of text just started and kept writing as it helps me. Thank you for reading, hope i contributed to the post.I used to get very bad auditory hallucinations (not sure if it was schizophrenia) when other people were speaking around me. They usually stemmed from me becoming anxious about myself or something, and then I would literally hear people speaking what I was anxious about, I hope that makes sense.

Like for example: 
I would be sitting a room with some people, panicking that my hair was too greasy or whatever I was wearing looked ugly.
And then coming from anyone speaking or talking I would literally hear them say in their own voice "He's greasy or he's acting weird, he dresses odd" ect.

Basically if I was worried about something, I would hear people pointing it out at me and saying it. Even though they weren't actually talking about me or even speaking at all.
I would often reply to these voices, only to get odd stares and confusion because it was actually all in my head. Making things ten times worse.

I did receive help and was given anti-anxiety medication as well as counseling and therapy that helped out a lot. Does anyone have issues with hearing internal music all the time? All.The.Time. Of course at night where you're trying to get to sleep. It's usually perfect, cd quality. You can pause it and replay. It's so realistic you notice details about the song that you never did before. You can even loop it. If you really concentrate you can change the song but there will always be one. During the day at work when things are suddenly calm and quiet you realize a song has been playing the entire time. You hum along for awhile until you are distracted. I was sleep deprived once and I heard music externally. Apparently that's "normal". This is definitely inside my head. I simply can't stop it. It's been decades. I've spoken to professionals. They don't get it. This is probably gonna get buried, but does anyone have any tips on how to let someone know they have schizophrenia? My friend has it, but doesn't know they're sick. Probably won't believe me if I try to tell them either.I don't want to scare anyone but if mental illness runs in your family, ie your mom or dad have schizophrenia, I would lay off weed or any of the hallucinogenic drugs. While every case is different, my cousin smoked a lot of weed in high school with his buddies which was seemingly innocent. Unfortunately he was one of the unlucky few that had a father with schizophrenia but he had no idea the drugs he was doing were going to trigger the disease that was in his DNA. Unfortunately he developed it in his early 20s and now lives alright in a group home. He sometimes makes sense but sometimes he'll say sentences like "Oh I remember you when you were a baby, you ate a ghost and the clouds in the sky are gray" So the first part of the sentence makes perfect sense, since he did live with me when I was a baby. It's the second and third parts of his statement that usually go off course into some weird random stuff. Usually I just smile and pretend the jibberish isn't a big deal and comment on the part that makes sense. LPT: If you're worried you may have schizophrenia you probably don't have it. Many people who are truly schizophrenic don't think anything is wrong with them. My little brother began telling me he would hear voices at age 16. He would also have hallucinations with food, it was writhing on his plate. Thus began a long food rigor. Oftentimes, the voices were loud in the shower for him, causing so much fear. It was difficult to get him to calm down to bathe.  He was a brilliant artist and a kind soul.Jesus fuck all this sounds so scary :/My mom was fully convinced our house was haunted for years. I would tell her about the woman's voice trying to keep me safe. "Don't touch that". "Don't go in there". Those types of things. I would see her for a second or two and then she would be gone. I have never been to a doctor and honestly I don't plan on it. I feel like I have some control over it. I only hear it occasionally a d I don't see her any more. I don't wanna make mountains out of mole hills.[removed]I was walking along St John Street in Clerkenwell in London one night in 2005 when I saw a guy dressed in medieval-style clothes slow-marching along the pavement and then disappearing into an old doorway.  A few minutes later another one appeared, a woman this time, then an old couple and on and on for quite some time.  All walking slowly to this one doorway and going inside.  The next day I went back and checked where the doorway led and it was a closed-down William Hill betting shop.  I have no explanation and nobody I have told believes me.I'd see these fucking black birds fly past in my peripheral vision. But shit looks different on different days. Stuff looks inverted, like it's moving, its borders are 'squiggling', I don't know. I'm not even technically diagnosed as schizophrenic, I have major anxiety disorder & clinical depression with 'psychotic' episodes. But of course to every person who knows that means I'm insane.I know someone that was convinced Ryan Reynolds was in love with her and was going to leave his wife (Blake Lively) and pick her up in his private jet to come live with him. She also believed she was a successful employee at marvel, and that she was instagram famous. She claims she’s better now, but what worries me is she hasn’t been put on any medication.My brother had it. He was diagnosed when he was 16 after he and some friends experimented with acid. He kept a journal in his room in which he would write detailed accounts of me and my father going into his room at night to pour battery acid on his head. He also heard voices, which I think was the first indication that there was something wrong. He also had these strange muscle ticks. We would be eating out and he would all of the sudden act as if he was conducting an orchestra by waving the silverware around. At one point he actually threw a fork clear across the restaurant. He also saw demons and would draw them in his sketchbook. 

Towards the end he would call our house in different characters/personalities warning us that voices were telling him to kill my sister, my father and myself. From what I understand, it manifests differently in everyone. As for my brother, I would describe it like a never ending acid trip gone awry.Med-surg hospital RN here. We often have psych patients. Most memorable for me was a late 20's guy who told me, "I didn't used to be crazy. I was normal once - like you. I became crazy in my twenties. I don't know what happened."
Made me sad. 
As someone with a fear of going crazy, I can't think of anything better to read before bed. What if all of you who are diagnosed with schizophrenia are right and all that you see or hear is real and the rest of us are just sleep walking through a life of control and supression.I'm not sure where else to post this. And seeing as I'm too poor to get a professional opinion, I guess this is as good a place as any to get advice.  

As a child, I had a very specific pattern of walking. Left foot forward for every third step, left for the other two. Left foot stepped on cracks right foot never did. If I was walking on tiles I'd only walk on one color.  I also occasionally saw a shadow that was that of a man in a top hat with no features other than red eyes. Around puberty this stopped.

Cut to age 19. After dealing with quite a few family issues. (restraining order against one parent, and being forced to live with the other who I hadn't seen in 10+ years. After a suicide attempt I moved back in with the first) I start doing drugs, mainly acid. Handled it well minus a few times where being in the bathroom gave me a panic attack. I tried DMT for the first time and had a complete meltdown. Since then, I have frequent audio hallucinations, like hearing my wife screaming my name, or women's laughter, or my children crying. During these panic attacks I become convinced that I'm living in a simulation. Nothing looks real, and I don't feel like I'm one entity. It feels like there is a break in mind/body. 

Any ideas on what it is or how to cope? Every method I've tried works for a little while, but soon starts failing.

A guy I know on his wedding night said his wife suddenly started screaming. Screaming like she was being raped. She started clawing at him and doing everything she could to stop him and he got off and was angry and confused. He met on of her personalities that night and had no idea he had multiple.Wow!
Reading through this I realized somthing, growing up roughly from 6-7 up to 17 yo, I've hear voices and see shadows and full conversations, to the point that I thought that it's my secret to be contacted with a parallel world!!

I didn't remember this until now like it never happend, it faded away, I wasn't introvert or anything, popular kid in the school and the community. Too samrt apparently to not notice it was off reality. My girlfriend from freshman year in college is developing symptoms. The moment I knew things were wrong was pretty recently (we're like 30 now) when she called me out of the blue and it went something like:

>Her: "You know I know Mike Judge right?"   
>Me: What really? How?  
>Her: "Well you know I've got a Sony Viao right? Same computer they use in Silicon Valley and I've always wanted to be an engineer..."  

I stopped really listening after that, just kind of being supportive even though she was clearly losing it. Both her older and younger brothers are diagnosed as schizophrenic, so it wasn't super surprising but I had just had drinks with her like 6 months prior and she had started a new job, seemed like her life was going well. 

She's at a mental hospital now and last time she called it was to tell me "You know you'll never be the next Ron Paul..." which was something I used to talk about ten years ago. 

I've stopped taking her calls. 
I have a relative from the generation ahead of me that has been a diagnosed schizophrenic for my entire life of around 35 years.

He recently underwent a brain scan due to an unrelated illness and they found evidence of a previously undiagnosed stroke that occurred many, many years ago.

They aren’t sure what to make of it, but... I guess it’s enough to make his doctors wonder if his psychiatric condition wasn’t related.  For my part, as a relative, I very much want to know if there’s a way, even posthumously, to diagnose it, similar to how CTE is both a physical condition with psychiatric symptoms.

His life has not been an easy one and it would be some comfort to better understand what happened and what could be done to better treat such a case.



I've no idea if I'm out of the ordinary at all, but people were sharing their experiences below so I thought I might as well.  When it's quiet and I'm alone, I have a tendency to act out negative scenarios in my head (especially in the shower), occasionally realizing my mouth is moving a bit, occasionally mumbling to myself.  I don't decide to do this, but it just sort of happens, and I often catch myself doing so.  I don't believe it's ever happened while someone else was around so no harm no fowl I suppose.  Sometime I have brief auditory hallucinations of people saying my name, or the occsasional negative comment, but I'm completely aware this is in my head so it doesn't really affect my behavior other than maybe my mood, so I don't think it's a problem.  I trained as a sound engineer and I compose music so I have a vivid auditory imagination so I don't think much of it.  I do have bouts of major depression but I wonder if that's just reality getting to me.  Who knows.  I'm ok I think, most of the time, just a bit weary.[removed][removed]When I found out that your conscious was only supposed to be one voice, not 3 with different tones.  Trick question. I didn’t. I had an “interesting” break. Omitting details and getting to point, had many people wanting me fired. (AOL Tech Support) I’d stay on the line until I Fixed the problem. Often meaning over an hour time call. Brought down the team’s numbers. The system required them to give me extra training and stage me down over a three month period. They wanted me out and (yes I know how this sounds, believe me, of all people) began doing various things with the goal of making it “look” like I was a psych hazard to the workplace. Enough people do enough even minor stuff (on top of psych damage from probs in high school...) caused an Actual psychotic break. I can Pinpoint (now in retrospect) the Moment they went from doing stuff to me to apparently “doing stuff to me”.  Had a conference meet at my psychiatrist (schizophrenia is not my first disorder, only the one that shattered my So badly I can’t work or function in public...) both parents and my psych tried to tell me “the people at work” (my own personal THEM) weren’t doing anything anymore or to the levels I perceived. I was Furious with all three for not believing me! After all, I was the victim of the abuse. I was experiencing it, of Course it was Real. Doc wanted me to try pills. I told her I’d Gladly take them! JUST to prove it wasn’t just me, just to prove her Wrong, and that after being on that they’d have to listen. Turned out, the antipsychotics Did help me and let me realize much of what “happened” never did. Then I knew. And knew how shattered my life would forever be. Very early in childhood ... I remember associating the numbers that I saw as friends .. and then I quickly realized it wasn't the same for everyone else.. but I never knew what I was seeing wasn't actually real ...A question for any of you who have had hallucinations - have you ever gone up to the person/thing you thought was there and tried touching them? If you did, what happened?I regularly see shadow people in passing vision and it freaks me out, anyone else get this?

I can see black distortions, when turning my head and its like someone just silently ran by. I didn't really realize how bad things were until well into my thirties. The -voices- or rather false memories had just become real. To the point where I would find myself in situations I was sure I had been in before. 100% completely sure. Or I'd see bugs that weren't there. Or be confused on why I couldn't find the thing that was crawling on me. Or asking people if they had called me. 

Now I still have those issues, but I realize they can be false. Though. Sometimes a spider can actually be crawling on me and I won't pay it any mind until I actually see it.I find after being stable on medicine for schizoid-affective disorder for now ~3 years it's really the lost opportunities.  I could be doing this or that if I never had this issue.  The lost times and opportunities are the real tragedy.  You find life is a lot of steps and if you stumble a few you are behind that much more.  Honestly, that's the hardest thing to reconcile with myself.  It's not the fact I have a disease.  It's the fact I denied it so long instead of accepting it and myself and moving onwards.  

If I had any advice for anyone who is recently diagnosed or struggling with a diagnosis is this; once you have meds you are stable with take them.  It's much better to be even kilter and blend into society.  All those things we should be striving for, like savings/retirement/education/relationships they won't always have the same opportunities later in life.

I am 29, a highly functioning schizoid-affective, finished university and work for a decent company.  It took me by age 26 to get to that point.  I am about four years behind professionally due to me not accepting my illness and myself.  If you have a diagnosis please accept all and any help.  I kept hearing voices. 

People were talkint shit on me.

I was the worst human in all of human history, and everyone knew it. 

My ego was taking advantage of me, only a few people know who I am! I knew this yet I couldn't shake the thought of guilt racing around my mind. 

I remember going on a run trying to calm the mind and I felt myself slowly losing all control of my mind. It was a terrible feeling. I felt hopeless and alone. 

Stay away from synthetic recreational drugs. That's what got me into a mental spiral. 

What really helped was writing down what was going on. As I wrote, I heard the group to the left of me say, "Delusion." Before I wrote they were saying many triggering things. I heard delusion and and wrote it down. Since then, exercise, meditation, creativity, speaking about my situation have brought me to a better place. [deleted][removed]I have been diagnosed with some not so bad schizophrenia and psicosis. Although is not merely schizophrenia since I don't hear anything that's not there, the first time I noticed I needed help was when I was on my early 20's.

I was in college, sitting on a bench and suddenly I started overthinking of linguistics. I couldn't conceive many ideas and my brain started thinking 1000% faster without going nowhere, suddenly I felt as I went deeper in my own ideas that I could end crazy, my body felt thicker as I could disappear. Thanks God a friend of mine got me out of that loop.

Immediately seek for help and the first psychiatrist told me that I had made an schizoid world that could end in schizophrenia and needed immediate treatment in a psyquiatric facility. 

Nevermind my family helped me a lot and seeked for more opinions.

Now I am completely stabilized and studying in other country with an all paid scholarship.

As a personal advice, seek for help, family will always be there for you and always, always look for a second opinion. 

The sensation of loosing who you are and going "crazy" is something nobody has to experience in their lives. 

<3...huh. That’s an interesting question. (Also got downgraded to psychotic depressive but whatever, my diagnosis was schizophrenia at one point.)

For me, I guess it was starting to think about people reading my thoughts, which ended up being one of my main delusions. The thing is, it wasn’t really a big deal at first - it was more like a little story I was telling myself, just a weird thing that popped into my head sometimes. Like when you knock on wood for luck even though you don’t actually believe it does anything supernatural. But then the idea slowly got stronger, and showed up more frequently, and all of a sudden it was terrifying and too real and I couldn’t control it. I knew the whole thing was mental but I was stuck in that gravity well of crazy just the same. That was my first ‘something is actually wrong, I want off this ride’ moment. Not schizophrenic myself but a member of my family is. She told me that when we were 8 or so, she would see corpses hanging from the basement ceiling.Scientifcally speaking, what CAUSES the voices? Hey there, 

Paranoid Schizophrenic here. Age 21. I was working on a drilling rig and was becoming increasingly paranoid that the food was spiked with drugs. The 12 hour days were rough, I was like a zombie and in a constant state of not talking or doing much on my final days, I was hearing voices of my motorhand laughing at me for not being good enough. I felt like everyone in the camp was out to get me, and I was soon "let go".  Fast forward a few months, after taking Adderall XR after not being able to afford the prescription for several months because of a previous diagnosis, I had a mental breakdown. Voices kept telling me to "Ride the lightning" so I had my headphones in my iPod with the song on non-stop repeat. For a few weeks I kept seeing "Colors" , it always felt like somebody in front of me was wearing green. I made up my own color code for the colors I saw, people wearing red meant "stop", people  wearing yellow meant "caution" and blue meant "go" , and white meant "right way" while if I started going the wrong way I'd see more "red" or "black" in my travels. I don't know how to explain it, but it got me home safely when I wasn't able to afford a phone for Maps. I referred to what I saw as "One Direction".  I was very reactive during that time, and one day I just totally broke down by going on a bus and I refused to open my eyes, and I eventually ended up in the psych of a hospital for a month. 

Until the meds stabilized me over time, I thought I was further being "tested" by people which was the result of the traumatizing effects that working on the rigs had on me. 

I am now on a monthly abilify injection for my paranoid schizophrenia.  Even though I feel normal now, I get a little bit shaky on the day I'm due for an injection and my reaction time is much slower than it use to be. I'm 26 now and I'm more motivated and stronger than ever. Not *diagnosed* schizophrenia, but I had Bipolar. Some of my medications made me experience aural hallucinations as well as visual.

The aural ones were wild because it was an audible manifestation of every shitty thing I've thought of myself. Try having intrusive thoughts when it's actually an outside voice telling you to do something.

Dialectical Behavioral Therapy really helped me with separating real from false with my aural hallucinations but the visual ones were weird in the sense it wouldn't be anything too extreme, other than the fact I would see and interact people that couldn't physically be there. 

Like my sister lived in California at the time. But once I woke up from a nap and she was sitting on the end of my bed and we had a conversation about life. 

Meanwhile my mom had to tell me that it was impossible that she had visited because she's at work and my mom just had spoken to her.

My visual hallucinations were fixed by titrating me off of medications. Now I'm only on prozac but at my craziest I was on 6 different medications at the same time, all relatively high dosages.

EDIT: Also, lots of delusions, and paranoia. Depressive episodes lead to anxiety about life and there was a point that I genuinely believed someone was stalking me and conspiring to assassinate me.I was sitting in a dispensary and was smoking some bud with my bestie when all of a sudden the TV in the room started directly talking to me. I asked my friend if he hears that and all he told me was "dude I think you're hearing voices, you might be schizophrenic". My world was never the same after that day.Pretty sure I experienced Schizophrenia as a child up until about 13. I would wake up in the middle of the night to the same screaming demonic voice in my head yelling profanities and telling me I was going to burn in hell etc. It would tell me not to mention it to anyone so I never did. Waking up in the morning was fun to as I got to see three shadow figures shoulder to shoulder rush me for the first few seconds of waking. I felt like there was something in the corner of my room that liked to watch me sleep every night but I got used to it to a degree. I would have compulsive images of sexualized religious figures run through my mind which I didn't enjoy or anything it's just that the more wrong the thoughts were, the more persistent they were. I grew up going to church as a kid but participating always made me feel alien and frightened because I didn't understand any of it and thought those compulsive thoughts could be heard by god which in turn fueled them even more. 
While I'm going I also used to have frequent nightmares involving decapitated heads, always running from someone who was going to decapitate me, or just being a decapitated, living head.
When did I find out? I have just recently been wondering whether or not my experiences all of which stopped happening at around 13 (19 now) would be considered schizophrenic. 
I'm not sure. Can anyone that had the heart to read all of that explain if what I experienced was Schiz?
This is my theory as to why it stopped and might help to any of you Reddit M.D.s to figure it out. 
My theory for as to why it stopped is because at a certain point (around 13) I built up the courage to literally talk back to the voices basically by just cursing back at it (myself?) and allowing the images to just flow instead of fighting them back in my head. Once I won the "battle" with my inner demon it left me alone which then allowed me to realize that the shadow figures didn't have any real control over my life. I realized they couldn't hurt me, send me to hell, possess me, or control me in any way if I just didn't allow it.
Sorry for the rambling but to reiterate; Was what I experienced during my childhood schizophrenia or a side effect of an admittedly hectic (and I mean hectic) household I.E. lots of screaming, violence, manipulation?Well reading all these has been mildly creepy for myself. While I don't have the voices in my head. I do share a LOT or similarities to what I've been reading from others. Like thinking there are cameras everywhere. Even in places I know there aren't any. Any time I get in the shower I have to look around for a camera, even though in my head I know they aren't there. Sometimes I get this feeling something's watching me in the shower, I usually ignore it. Another is hearing things that aren't there. Like, I'll hear sounds or people say things that's never actually happened. For instance there have been many times where I've been around friends and I thought I heard them say something, I ask them what they said and they just look at me and say they didn't say anything. Or I'll hear dogs barking, or just weird sounds somewhere that No one else hears. And finally shadow people. Mostly when in cars I'll be staring out the window, see someone walking then as soon as something obstructs my view of them they disappear. Like say a telephone poll comes between me and them. They completely disappear. This happens a lot. Even worse my grandpa is schizophrenic (though I don't know if it's genetic or not) so yeah. TIL I might be schizophrenic.I’ve been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder (bipolar type), severe GAD, and borderline PD traits. I was raised in an psychologically abusive, neglectful household.

I did not truly realise anything was wrong until I was ~16. I started cutting at 12 and have yet to go a full year without relapsing (though now it’s at most twice a year whereas I sometimes spent hours self-harming trying to cut things out of my head (though I didn’t cut my head; mostly my legs and breasts). When I cut the paranoia stopped, until it didn’t work anymore. Then I cut because “it” told me to.

Because of how hesitant people are to diagnose severe disorders like this I went through literally 15 different diagnoses (including pervasive developmental disorder, MDD, and bipolar) before anyone would recognise that that wasn’t the problem. I’ve been hospitalised more times than I can count on one hand and was involuntarily admitted to residential treatment for about 6 months when I was 15 (was released on my 16th birthday only because my insurance refused to cover any more days). AMA, I guess?[removed]I started slapping my arms because the mosquitoes were fucking terrible at this outdoor Phish concert!!!! Then my friends informed me there was no mosquitoes out. I looked at my arms and saw nothing, but felt a lot. Tactile hallucinations!I think my grandma has it. She thinks that “they” want to poison her. She cooks for us and it’s delicious, but she never eats the leftovers, unlike us. When she doesn’t cook herself, she doesn’t eat what we’ve prepared and gets something from the shop and hides it under her bed from “them”. She’s been pretty open with me about it at times and I’ve managed to show her in a subtle manner that some things are not as she thinks they are, but I am concerned and don’t know how to properly help her. 

She refuses to see a doctor about it. I just want her to come out of her room and live a happy life. What could I do to help her or get her to let her be checked?At times I'll hear my mom yell my name(which I haven't seen her in 5+ years). I hear my front door open all the time. But it's closed. And I would hear the school bell at very weird times. I thought this was normal until I told a friend of mine. He said that it is not. I don’t suffer from schizophrenia, but the very palpable auditory and visual hallucinations I experience during sleep paralysis give me a small inkling what it must be like to have do deal with it. I ended up not having skizophrenia but was afraid I did for awhile. I would get weird hallucinations at night around bedtime, i would wake up and odd stuff would happen toys talk to me and scrounge around the room scaring me to death. Turned out it was just sleep paralysis which I still have issues with. I just know now that after I regain control that its just my brain having issues getting out of REM sleep.For me, it was less that i ever noticed it myself and more that everyone around me was noticing it and telling me something was wrong. For a schizophrenic yet to be on medication, having everyone around you say that your perception of reality is not skewed, is a very scary and lonely feeling.No matter where I am I always KNOW some one is watching. As a kid I would hear murmurs,but now it's more like someone talking behind a wall.I haven’t been officially diagnosed because it is so minor. My psychologist said it isn’t enough to diagnose or Medicate but I always remember hearing children playing down in the holler. I would go down there and never see anyone. We lived on a 300 acre farm and the closest family was over a mile away with teenagers. I still sometimes see people walking in the middle of the street when I’m driving. I hear very very faint music or mumbling as well but very rare occasions. It sounds like I left a video playing on my phone in my pocket. When my depression was at it worst I heard voices telling me to kill myself or someone else. On those occasions those voices were also extremely faint. I went for months on 3 occasions believing I was Jesus. Diagnosed bipolar but sounds a little schizo to me.

I’ll go back to fighting off homelessness now. Spent too much this last run a couple months back. Credit card debt has a different hurt to it. Stack the 10k on the 100k student debt and 500/mo car. I hear ppl live in storage units. Sleep in my car a lot prolly.When my bed started levitating.I personally do not have this disorder, but my cousin did. I can not say much other than the fact that it drive him insane and eventually to the point where he would kidder his girlfriend and my aunt and uncle would come home to her floating in the pool. He is now spending the rest of his life in a mental institution.I read that I have dormant schizophrenia. I ate way too many special brownies and I had this horrifying voice talking to me and telling me to do horrid things to my husband. Telling me I was going to die. I can't eat or smoke anything again in fear of releasing the voices. Truly the most terrifying thing I have ever experienced.I was super stressed for work and how I was failing to keep up. Been having Sleeping problems. Usually as I was running to work in the morning I started hearing voices of people calling my name. And it is pretty unique name. At first I thought coincidence. After happening every day and in random places for a span of few months. I thought someone was joking. Then things started appearing and disappearing in my apartment and at work. I would really believe someone stole my MacBook even if I never bought one. But somehow I saw it on my desk yesterday. I would hear noises in the middle of the night. Shadows of people wandering in my apartment. 


It took me some time to realize I was hallucinating. Most of the time I thought I was part of a sick joke. Kind of like Truman style. 

Now I'm much better Does anyone with schizophrenia like having it? I heard some schizophrenic people have mainly good voices in their heads and I couldn't imagine hating an illness that makes me feel like people are always rooting me on or giving me confidence... just curious.Age 16.i had just gotten back from a long hospital visit from self harm and suicide attempt and I was put on seroquel. I started hearing voices at home and I told my mom what was going on. They thought it could be my new meds so they took me off of them. They didn't go away. When we went to the doctor again I was so afraid of going back to the hospital that I told them the voices went away when they really hadn't. I have been with them ever since. Can schizophrenics differentiate between a hallucinations and real stuff? prolly when I imagine like im giving a motivational speech in front of my friends that I would never really have the opportunity to do in real lifeI know this is just a delusion, but I feel as if there is interdimensional being watching everything I do. Sometimes I feel as if all of our thoughts are connected and what I think about during the day goes into the dream world when I fall asleep, and when I fall asleep it leaves my thoughts open for other people to hear them. I know this sounds crazy, believe me I know. But for some reasons I can't help but think these things are true during some times in my life, when I start to think about it in my day to day life I start to daze and act out of it. I don't know if I have schizophrenia. Metal disorders run in my family. My aunt has an extreme bipolar disorder and my cousin has schizophrenia (in an episode he believed that our other cousin was the reincarnation of Moses here to save us, he's a functional accountant now.) Are these early warning signs? I know these are delusions, but I'm scared that everyone who has schizophrenia knows in the beginning that they are delusions. Am I just stressing myself out?So I sat here trying to pinpoint the moment I knew something was wrong. I honestly couldn't. It developed so slowly that any slight change from my behavior before, was normal to me. I knew I was 'weird' and that I had 'imaginary friends' but it was so normal to me, I didn't question my sanity. I developed this disorder at a really young age, maybe that's why I didn't realize what was going on? I have never been diagnosis with it however my mom and sister have... I didn't understand what my mom what was wrong with my mom because I was young. It was until my sister started being weird and talking about seeing things and hearing thingsand her being diagnosed I was like hey... that happens to me too... I never told anyone. Usually I hear voices and see what look like ghosts. Not all the time by enough to scare me. I also sleep walk... parents knew about the sleep walking though.Magical thinking. Elaborate imagined circumstances that start off harmless enough but develop into full on delusions. This and lack of sleep, general mania. Trouble is, most people never think there is anything wrong with themselves. Almost never happens. Yeah there are a lot of people that feel like there is a hidden camera on them all the time. I am one of those people.
However mine comes more from living with schizophrenic people who actually HAD cameras than from experiencing schizophrenia myself. I have a question for those that experienced it. 

Back in 2005/6 when I was like 13, my mum would see a man following her when she dropped my younger brother to school, just far enough away but very menacing. She would also see him in the window so she kept the curtains shut constantly. One day my brother just screamed at the man to go away but I don’t think he ever saw him, just to please my mum, we all knew she saw this man, she was terrified. 

Back then we went to a Christian church, they were convinced she was being stalked by a demon so went in for an exorcism, they came round and prayed for ages, since then she claims to have never seen him again, but the curtains often stay shut still. She says prefers them shut at the sunlight shines on the TV when she’s watching it, it maybe just be a habit. 

So my question is can it be temporary? I’ve completely forgot about this until I saw this thread and never thought it to be schizophrenia. You know, reading those people's comments makes me think mostly that they have paranormal senses or stuff like that. Seeing shadowy people, hearing sounds no one else does and so on... some say they even hear the radio or TV! I'd assume it has something to do with brain being sensitive like very accurate TV antenna. That's just a shower thought though.Just reading all these responses reminds me how many horror movies use mental illness as part of their storylines and I wonder if people who are diagnosed with bipolar or schizophrenia avoid that genre as a result. Except in horror films, people who see shadows on walls, or feel people stalking them or haunting them via auditory voices are really telling the truth and their friends, family and co-workers want to constantly tell them they are going crazy and need to be committed. In real life, the general consensus is that the auditory voices and shadows on the wall or paranormal stuff are a figment of our imaginations and the result of possible mental illness. The horror movie genre exploits that ambiguity though and possibility that perhaps there really is another world out there. I do not have schizophrenia, but in my high school psych class, we had to interview a family member with a mental illness, I chose my great uncle who had schizophrenia. This was similar to a question that we had to ask. My uncle said that he started hearing people telling him things like "get the guns" "we aren't safe" "they're going to hurt (insert family member name)" but nobody would be around to be saying them. It was a really long time before my uncle got formally diagnosed with Schizophrenia, because he was born in the 50's and not a lot was understood about schizophrenia, so he had to deal with this for most of his life. When I was a little girl he used to scare me, before I understood what was going on. I regret not spending more time with him. He died in a psychiatric prison a few years ago.  My brother has schizophrenia, and the first time we realised something was wrong when he said he was going to stay up late (which wasn’t an issue because he usually did), so I went to bed.
Later that night I woke up because he was talking, so I went down because I thought someone was in the house. I asked him who he was talking to and he said Batman and Robin. I asked him whether he’d been on our PS4 (recently got Arkham City) and he said that Adam West was sitting opposite him, and didn’t believe me when I told him that he had died, because he was “right there”.
Took him to hospital, he got sectioned and now is doing very well controlling it with himself and medication Can schizophrenia develop later in life? And is it hereditary?I’m so fearful that my mom has schizophrenia. She thinks everyone (a slight exaggeration) is out to get her or following her around. It’s something she’s developed over the past few years. She can never tell you *who* is out to get her, she just says, “I don’t know...just...*they*!” She had a high-profile job in academia and quit because she couldn’t handle the feeling of being followed by those she’d pissed off at work. To clarify, no one has ever followed her. She refuses help because, in classic form, she doesn’t need the help - we just don’t believe her! It may have already been posted elsewhere but on YouTube there is a content creator, Frankenmoose, who makes videos demonstrating, as close as he can, his auditory and visual hallucinations. They’re terrifying and eye opening. I very rarely hear any voices but I had a lot of invasive thoughts about harming people. I had thoughts about attacking little children and also every time I was visiting my parents I had thoughts about killing them . I was diagnosed with undifferentiated schizophrenia.A friend of mine that I've known since we were kids started taking adderal and started alienating everyone. He called me at 1 in the morning and accused me of stealing a clay vase he made for his mom in high school. I just brushed off his weird behavior on the adderal but my dad kept telling me that it seems worst than just drugs and not long after my friend found out he has schizophrenia. When I started having nightmares of monsters that are kinda hard to describe. I'll just call them shadow beasts. The nightmares then broke through and existed in the real world..
Yea my childhood was not very pleasant. You mean when people said I wasnt "quite right"? I feel fine. I couldn't figure why other people didn't see who I was talking to, or understand when lights flickered to get me to react, the people on tv and radio are talking to me just as I would to someone across the table from me, or all the people conspiring to create havoc in my life for their personal amusement, the worst was when I became fed up with people reading my mind so I got in their face about it because they were cowards and wouldn't be open about it.

 I guess it started about 10 or 11

....and even with treatment and a tested and trusted sounding board to tell me if it's real or not..... I still know I am right and people are just messing with me, but I'll let it go because I trust my companion who for some Bizaar reason has stuck with me 30 years.When I started to hear nonsense opera style singing. Before I would never hear voices just random sounds. 

Tbf the opera singers in my head are not malicious and are on point with the tunes.Check for sleep apena
This is an interesting/scary simulation of what it's like living with this disease...

It was more a retroactive thing. The two psychiatrists I saw asked me a lot of questions about hallucinations, blackouts, delusions, hearing voices, etc. etc. Before seeing professionals I considered those a part of just being "a little weird." They added up the numbers, hit the = button, and gave me a result.

So I had only considered myself abnormal in the same way that someone with a temper or a phobia was abnormal. Normal thought nudged in an extreme direction. Only after seeing professionals did I look back and think, "Oh. Yeah, I guess when you put it together like that, that's a condition, huh."

The event that lead to me going for evaluation was actually a spike in daily hallucinations (seeing faces, hearing voices, contesting with another entity I perceived in my mind), paranoid delusions (like suddenly believing I was about to be killed), and more intense experiences I prefer not to revisit here. But again, I didn't make anything of it. Even the worst of it, I had other, less firm explanations for. Someone I told about it insisted that I go to a psychiatrist. I think I must not have been social enough at the time to realize that people don't typically work like that. I was very closed-off.

A lesson for others experiencing similar symptoms, I guess: What you're going through might be more extreme than you think. Talk to someone and see if you're actually colouring inside the lines.I was walking through town and heard someone yell out something from a car and was convinced they were yelling at me. I heard my name shouted. But thought it may just be a mate. Then it kept happening. I would hear someone yelling and would be convinced it was directed at me. I would often hear my name, and was sure everyone was looking at me. But I take medication for it and have no issues at all for the last five years or so.is there a definitiv way to test if you have/are shizophren?I'm the heavily medicated voice hearing paranoid schizophrenic, but I do function like a normal person most days.These answers are so fucking creepy I think I'm gonna have nightmaresA lot of these answers are about positive symptoms. Are there anyone who started noticing something strange with negative symptoms, or anyone who primarily had negative symptoms? 

My grandmother had  schizophrenia in the midst of a famine, so everything was exacerbated. She didn't recognize her own son or husband, and just stared at the wall all day without speaking to anyone. She was in her own blank world.

I know the famine probably was both the trigger and the thing that made her condition so awful, but my both my aunts and one of my cousins also have schizophrenia, and I think only one of them has positive symptoms. I guess I want to know what to prepare for. 

They're all in China, and I remember how everyone went out of their way to not discuss mental illness at all in the family. I wasn't even sure it was schizophrenia and when I asked my parents as a teenager, they straight up lied to my face about it. I only managed to get them to tell me the truth recently. I am not at all as prepared as I should be.

My dad doesn't have it, and it's good side of the family. That's gotta be a good sign, right? He's the only one who doesn't have it, which is funny because his sisters all have it and I thought it was supposed to be more common in guys.So I may be a little late on this, but I have a friend who I think is developing Schizophrenia and I’d like some opinions on what his symptoms could mean. He’s in love with a girl who lives in Germany who was a foreign exchange student at our high school. He’s convinced himself that she’s being held hostage by her boyfriend (no reason to believe) and that he has to fly to Germany to rescue her and he’s been posting threats to her BF and now believes that he has hacked all her social media and that he is talking to him through her accounts. He believes that someone has put a hit put out on him. He believes that he has a special learning ability that allows him to learn like no one else can. He has told me in one instance that he did indeed hear a voice say something, though at least it was positive. He hasn’t been sleeping much at all and to top it off he is 100 percent certain he’s gonna make all his family and friends rich by selling knives and making music. I know an official diagnosis can’t be given, but if you had to place a bet on this, would the more informed perhaps say it’s Schizophrenia?
I always heard my name randomly
Since a while ago I had a lot of fun fucking other people's minds, making them feel bad, useless, etc. amongst other things. Although the moment I felt something was wrong was when in the psychologist, with my mother, while we were discussing the reasons on why I had developed such critical levels of depression and anxiety, I was smiling so hard I felt like I didn't have enough mouth width to smile harder, and at a moment I starting laughing out loud like I had heard the best joke ever -- all of this because my mom crying her ass not being able to talk properly felt pretty funny. A bit late here, but what the hell. 

I was pretty young, around 12 years old i think. 
Started hearing whispers, they didn't really say anything i was able to understand. They got louder. 

They got so fucking loud, that it sometimes gave me headaches. Sometimes it was loud whispers, sometimes it was yelling, lucky for me though they were never telling me to do anything nasty. 
But I was young, so I did not really understand what was going on, mostly I would just cry until it would go away. 

Went to a shrink, got meds, I am totally fine today. 
Apparently severe ADHD, plus a healthy dose of anxiety and chronic stress can cause schizophrenia. Go figure. An unseasonable amount of butterflies I was riding my bike down the street when I heard children laughing.  I was 16 at the time and found it very disconcerting that it persisted for 9 blocks, and then continued as I rode back home. Lasted for years... I took rispridone for about 3 years to mute these auditory  hallucinations. Luckily it went away on its own. l hear sounds. Ok, so I've been reading through these comments and it's getting kind of terrifying that a lot of what you people are saying is SCARILY accurate. So maybe I'm just being paranoid again, or maybe something more serious but can someone suggest like the next step for if you do encounter these "symptoms" or the "red flags" if you will. I'm genuinely worried that I am now schizophrenic.I don't have schizophrenia but I have something that is similar. 

I first noticed something was wrong when I didn't leave the house for a month. I have a lot of things like this happen; I think i hear televisions when it's quiet, when I'm trying to sleep voices can echo in my head, which used to scare me when I was a child, I always think I hear people talking about me and I see the faces of people I know anytime I can't fully see a stranger's face. I don't know, is that normal?I used to have really bad nightmares and depression starting in my early twenties. Drs would suggest that I saw lights out of the corner of my eye and with that diagnosed me as schizophrenic. I took an anti psychotic for a few years and my nightmares went away. It’s been over a decade. I’m totally not schizophrenic but worry that it’s on my record. I have also taken tests that claimed I have high functioning Aspergers. That actually explains a lot. I’m not really depressed but sometimes it’s hard to get out of bed because there is nothing to look forward to and I’ll start to have very negative thoughts about my value as a person which is actually very low but it normally doesn’t bother me and sometimes I can even not care. When I don’t care that I don’t have any value people react differently to me and things work out better.I started hearing voices when I was like 11. I couldn't control them but I could talk with them, kinda cementing the idea that I controlled them with my thoughts. I reached out to my teacher about this and she associated it with my random out of character aggression and my constant feeling of hopelessness. She talked to the counselor who then referred a shrink It took me a very long time to recognize my symptoms. I would have things happen like someone called my name in a crowded space, or someone just beyond earshot was calling my name. I wrote it off as anxiety for about two or three years before I mentioned it to a friend, and he told me that wasn't normal. 

Right now I'm in the med trial phase of figuring it all out. Balancing 19 credits of senior classes and having my brain pulled 5 different ways is fun....Story of my brother : I'm 22 years old . I studied at the university where I received a scholarship for the first year.When the second year started ,something changed. I don't know why .. I have good friends, family... I enjoyed my life. But I got into a deep depression. I started to use antidepressants while everything was okay but later it did not help anymore.
Last year I have problem do anything.I don't hear voices, but I have feeling what i must do .Such as.. I must stay on one place some hours of sitting on toilet or stay in my room half of day .It's terrible feeling because i don't want do this . I am paralyzed in my feelings. I don't want stay on one place I want do something else but I can't.
Doctors don't know how to help me they are not sure if it's schizophrenia or something else .I have depression too. Doctors  try give me more pills, more  Antidepressant and Antipsychotic but nothing helped me, they also try ECT  and no effect. The first thing when I come home I stand up to my place. I do not know how long it will last. This is not real life. Does anyone have similar problems? Thanks.Often when I came home late from work, I thought hearing my father talking from upstairs. When listening more carefull the voice stopped.  I don't think I have schizophrenia, but I spent my teen years talking to my self, mainly about ways to kill my abusive mother. Looking back I am all the more glad I ignored the voice. i guess something always felt off...but it really became obvious after i hit puberty...I want to preface by saying i don’t have full blown schizophrenia, I have bipolar one with psychotic episodes. One night while during a manic period, I kept seeing little bugs crawl from my hardwood floor and into my couch. While most people would ignore this and maybe realize that it was a hallucination, I instead flipped my couch over and took a knife to it, cutting it open on an effort to find the bugs. Reading this thread just terrified me. Where's the line between "eyes playing tricks on you" and actual,diagnosable schizo? Is there a "normal" amount of hearing/seeing things, or is that not as common as I'm thinking?When your mind starts burning. I always think of stranger things when I read stuff like this.[removed]I had it when I was younger but I don't experience it anymore it was pretty bad I couldn't sleep at all at times... I'm 20 and I don't feel it anymore it just disappeared. Hopefully it will stay like this till I'm gone lolI hear my mother or fathers voice repeating over and over. The phrases change on whatever I have the most anxiety about. It gets hard when I’m with my girlfriend. I tell her and she helps me relax, but I think deep down it scares the fuck out of her. I can’t let that be a burden to her, but that anxiety brings the voices back. The first major event was back when I worked at the local cinema.
It'd been a slow day and I had ventured into one of the screens to watch a movie (it was a VERY casual work environment).  After maybe 20mins I remember deciding to leave the screen to make sure I wasn't needed for any work (cleaning screens that had emptied, cleaning the corridor leading to the screens, seating a particularly busy screen).

The screens themselves were seperated from the corridor by an 'airlock' or two sets of doors and as I passed through the second set of doors and looked down the corridor to where my co-workers were I had my first lucid delusion.

I should note that my delusions/hallucinations aren't just a singular sense, but a complete 'experience'.  Tactile memories, sounds, events and even taste all occur at once, it's incredibly overwhelming and the combination of them prevents me from telling them apart from reality whilst they occur.

Anyways back to the story.  When I looked down the corridor and saw my colleagues I felt rage for some reason that I can no longer recall.  Next thing I remember is the feel of the carpetting on my hands as I ran, hunched on all fours, towards them.  I saw them turn to see me and laugh until I lunged at the closest and tore his throat out with my teeth.  I can tell you now that I could taste his blood in my mouth, I could hear their screams and I could see the blood spray from the open wound.  I then turned and slaughtered one after another and then as soon as it had begun it stopped.  I was stood outside of the screen I had emerged from, no blood, no screaming, no dead colleagues just the 'memory'.

I know this all sounds far-fetched and I'll tell you this much, I doubt I'd believe anyone telling me the same story had I not experienced it myself.

I first saw a doctor in response to this about 6 months later and it was diagnosed as depression, two weeks later I was escalated to the local Mental Health Team for psychiatric review which came a further month later.  Original diagnosis from a psychiatrist was Paranoid Schizophrenia, Agoraphobia and Depression, over the last 10 years that diagnosis has changed (depending on the psychiatrist) to Schizotypal Disorder, Paranoia, Depression and Agoraphobia.  I have also been diagnosed with Schizoeffective Disorder but, as I have never seen the same psychiatrist twice, the diagnosis often changes.mmmmm i think the first moment was when somebody told me I do certain thing and I cannot remember anything about that
I was seven on Christmas Eve, I kept hearing a voice and then stared for hours out of the window to an alleyway near my house, I was convinced there were 3 demons dressed as people trying to kill people. It all started from then, I didn't say anything to anyone about it until I was 17How should I go about talking to my doctor about this? I've definitely experienced some of these symptoms "phantom radios playing, loud horns, being sure that someone is in my house when it is absolutely secure?I went to a concert my friend's band was playing at. I smoked some weed and noticed a girl who seemed pretty cool. I got nervous, embarrassed myself, and walked away to go outside on the lawn to think. There were a lot of people there because it was a multi band concert during the day at a school in the summer. I laid down to think and the people around me started taking about the matrix. It was like everyone was saying my thoughts. I had a new hobby at the time, because I started following the white rabbit, and that kinda freaked me out. It was all encompassing and didn't stop.

About 6 months later I went to a party with my friends at college and told them to listen to their surrounding environment. One of my friends noticed and was surprised and went on to say he was a god. Another friend, who I'm still kinda talking to, already knew about this. We went back the next night and she said something about being self aware, and I went on to study her for a few months through what I perceived as Thought Broadcasting.I hallucinated a big ass pair of titties haha As a kid. I could see and do things others couldn't and at 14 finally asked to see a psychologist because I felt I was losing my mind. After some screening tests run by a group of professionals, they talked to me and my parents and told me I had a very high I.Q. and that "superiority" was going to make life more difficult for me. I remember feeling very disappointed because it was not my I.Q. I was worried about, I felt like they had totally missed the point. I'm 36 now and have a perfectly functional life, though I do receive medical treatment. I hope you've found my answer helpful.Good question enjoyed reading the answers [deleted]I started seeing numbers and equations on window panes. I started to see photosynthesis happen in broad daylight. I started to wake up and smell the music and hear the coffee.Not sure if it's schizophrenia but I do have a few of the symptoms. One that really creeps me out is voices. Sometimes I just hear one but sometimes there's two or three and it's like there's a conversation going on in my head that I'm not a part of. Usually when I notice it and try to focus on it they stop but occasionally I catch a sentence or two  and I'm freaked out for the rest of the day. It happens when I'm wide awake and doing stuff too so I know it's not just sleep related.I often have delusion of grandeur. Not because I’m ill, I’m actually the king of the universe 😉

I have auditory hallucinations sometimes. I put this down to stress (I hope). My uncle had the condition and it developed late in his life. So it’s always at the back of my head that I could end up with it. I don't have schizophrenia. This video is intended to simulate the symptoms. 

***content warning*** 
I really don't want to trigger anyone who may suffer from schizophrenia. 
[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYwckFrksg)[removed]My serious question is, Do this voices you hear are they different tones or is it your own voice. I'm also curious about the hallucinations. Do you see something vivid or do you see something from the end of your eye sight but then turn around and it's not there anymore.Lately I’ve begun to wonder if something is wrong with me. I’ve never talked about this to anyone else before but this seems like most people here have personal experience. I don’t normally hear voices, in the same way you actually hear other people talking. But I feel that I don’t control my thoughts. My mind is always creating elaborate plots against me that I can still write off as ridiculous so I consider myself normal, but I told myself this a long time ago and it happens almost all day now. The only thing I find really disconcerting though is I’ve noticed that when I stay up late, say staying awake for 20+ hours straight, I do actually hear voices. They don’t feel like they’re in my head, but it feels like the same sensation when you hear people actually talking. Only it’s never intelligible, it’s basically just babbling and shouting. I also feel my communication skills degeneratingI honestly think I should go find out after reading most every response here. I really hope the replies here were serious, because they might have compelled me. I feel like this an appropriate thread to say this, but I worry that I have or am prone to schizophrenia as my Dad has it. He was diagnosed at age 17 and it was drug induced. I don't see him any more as he has done things to make me uncomfortable, but from what I've heard he spends most of his time in psych hospitals or homes. 

I am 17 with a history of mental health issues and have experienced hallucinations.

This thread is an insight to me.I wasn't diagnosed with schizophrenia, but I had a psychotic episode, and the psychiatrists thought I had a good chance of being diagnosed. 

I didn't know I was psychotic because I was delusional and in my own little world. The only reason I got help was because my parents told me I wasn't thinking clearly, and to trust them, even though I didn't.

I was smoking a lot of pot at the time, and they said that was probably the cause. I abstained and recovered. It was a scary time.[deleted]I have bipolar 1 disorder and I have auditory hallucinations, and some visual. I'm fairly certain I inherited bipolar from my mother, and had a narcissistic upbringing, which I'm assuming triggered the onset from an early age, I'd guess around 8 or 9. They diagnosed me with ADHD and put me on Ritalin, which is when I remember having my first psychotic break. It felt like everyone was watching me and waiting for me to fuck up, I was high on the medication and was terrified of everything. This was also a period of my life (~10 years old) that my mother was especially abusive toward me physically and mentally, and my dad was stationed overseas. I don't know how I pulled through that psychotic break, but I was definitely bullied in school and didn't have any friends until around high school. Got diagnosed at 18. Been medicated consistently since about 24.

The most common auditory hallucination I have is when I'm sitting alone doing my studies and a radio will be playing in the room with me. There isn't actually a radio though, just a silent room. The music is muffled, like I'm listening through a wall, but clear enough that I can pick out a beat and the tinny crashes of a high hat. It gets so annoying sometimes that I look around the room and say "Stop!" aloud to myself, but of course it doesn't. Eventually it will dissipate into a hum and then completely go away on its own. Really freaking annoying though. 

The common visual hallucination I have is shadow people. If I'm getting into my truck I will check the back seats by turning around, and more often than not see these dark shadows move quickly out of my line of sight. Gets my sympathetic nervous system reared up for action every time. I also see them while driving (ie one will cross the road quickly) or when I'm walking through campus. The worst part about these is the associated feeling that someone is *right there* and they're out to harm me. Schizotypal disorders are not fun.Well as much as I like drawing attention to myself and feeling special, this thread made me realize I am definitely *not* schizophrenic.

Just a little weird, apparently.There have been so many responses to this thread already, but I'm wondering about the people who came to the conclusion they had schizophrenic symtoms when they were under the influence of drugs. Like during a bad trip induced by weed or psychedelics. Yo so anyone who has not been officially with schizophrenia need to stop commenting on these posts about how their self diagnosis is somewhat related to the affected. Just delete you fucking comment, you're worried that much get professional help. I've felt like I've been all alone in this situation and finally for the first time in my life I see people who are openly talking about it. It's great that non diagnosed show interest but talking like you even have a remote idea what's it's like? Get real. (upset bc I read so many people who think they have M.d. by their names)When I was sleeping 6-7 years ago I felt a finger creeping up towards my leg from the behind ( I was sleeping towards  the wall ), something was fucking behind me and it had a creepy old voice telling me That
 “ I am coming for you Sarp “ as a 11 year old I was horrifically terrified at that moment it was coming higher to my head and torso so I built up My  courage and turned back , I know I wasn’t going to see something I mean who the fuck has that kinda dream state ? And I turned ,
There  was nothing , the finger vanished and I continued my sleep , I don’t fully remember how I did it . That was one of the scariest thing I have encountered Just posting this so I can read later. I think I might be schizophrenic..Not me (there's always one) but I went to see Jon Ronson give a talk a while back and one of his guests was this lady called Eleanor Longden. She was schizophrenic and had first started having symptoms when she was in college. She said she woke up one morning and got out of bed, and heard a voice narrating it. The voice continued narrating everything she did, like that movie Stranger Than Fiction. She said at first she didn't really mind it, once she got used to it, and she didn't even really think there was anything wrong with her until she mentioned it to her room-mate who told her to go to the doctor immediately. But over time the voice got more aggressive and then other voices started joining in until there was just constant noise and talking in her head all the time telling her that she was worthless and despicable etc etc. She ended up having to drop out of college and her life was pretty much put on hold for years while she struggled with it.

Nowadays of course she's doing really well, after years of different medications and therapies, and said she still hears voices but that they're mostly pretty nice and friendly - that evening as she left her hotel to come on stage with Jon Ronson they'd wished her luck with it. It was bizarre and I can't imagine it, but she was incredible. Holy shit i used to have this as a kid i didnt know what it was the toilet paper roll and a small bucked wt had in the bath used to always argue whole staring at me i remember this.Most people with schizophrenia don't really agree they have it.I'm not actually schizophrenic, but there was a time when I was living on 1-2 hours sleep on average per night, and on heavy ADD medication, and I believe I might've encountered some symptoms at the time, looking back. Since I'm no expert, I can't say for sure.

Late at night while working on assignments on my laptop, I'd see black silhouettes appear in the corner of my eye, floating into the room, and at one time at 2 A.M. I loudly heard a male voice call my name, seemingly originating from my right side, startling the fuck out of me.

Later, when I would be in bed, still awake from the medication, old voices that seemed distantly familiar and nostalgic would tell me things like incomplete fragments from old movies. The most striking one was the voice of an unknown little girl calling out the name of my deceased family dog 'Buster'. Immediately after I was flooded with an image of a warm summer afternoon outside of my childhood home, looking out at a field towards a sun that was starting to set.

When I was in such a state, I would look closely at for example the table and feel like my eyes were zooming in at microscopic levels, and at times my vision would fail me and make it impossible to read fine print.

I would very much like to know from someone who knows more about it ot  people actually suffering from schizophrenia whether my medicated state of being at the time may have made it possible for me to exhibit schizophrenic symptoms, or if it was simply exhaustion-induced hallucination with me using concerta and dexamphetamine, refusing to let my body rest.[removed]I don't have schizophrenia, but my dad and a few uncles do.  Reading some of these comments are concerning me, because I sometimes "see a shadow or person" that isn't actually there.  Or someone walks by me when I'm looking down, but no one is around
I'm 33 and I talked to my Dr about it when I was a teenager, and she knew the history with my dad.  She asked me a few questions, and basically said if it was a worry that I would have had problems much sooner

Guess I'll call the DrI'm fairly certain my roommate has it. I hear him talk to people that are not there in length (like more than 5 minutes at a time), most of the time it's negative things. Not sure who to contact but it progressed much worse.How do you handle relatives with schizophrenia? My brother has it super bad at moments to the point he constantly threatens killing the household.. Otherwise he's fine, good morals, high restraint(we'd be dead if not), and generally sociable. Kinda worried he's willing to jump bridge tho, he fucked up early on in life and the consequences are massive because his undesirable traits just started spiraling due to circumstance.. the guy just gets shit from everyone because he has to beg for money to buy drugs to cope. Nothing to his name or anything...[deleted]Wow, I had no idea that people had hallucinations this badly. Reading through this thread was eye opening (no pun intended).I know I’m probably late, but I’d like to ask a follow up question to people posting on here. I’m a student who looks to study and work with schizophrenics. I hope to one day help increase public awareness and enhance treatment for the afflicted. Is there anything you guys feel would help you with treatment? Is there anything you would like to tell the public beyond friends and family members? Are you satisfied with how your life is under medication, or do you feel like there is room for improvement (stronger meds, more or less frequent scheduled dosages)
I know this is probably a case by case basis, but I’d really love to hear you guys out. Also, I’d like to reiterate, that I am just a student who has a huge interest in mental illness and schizophrenia, I’m not a doctor (maybe someday) and I just wanted to hear from a personal level since it’s not every day I get this opportunity.

Edit: Apparently, my post came off as offensive to some people. I’d like to emphasize that I am only here to help, I am not here to replace any experts or do anything other than help contribute progress to the development of better treatments. I believe public awareness on mental illness is still drastically low and the public should be made aware that mental illness is something that happens to the best of us.

A poster below stated that some the best experts on schizophrenics are schizophrenics themselves, I was also told not to attempt replace them. I have no want whatsoever to replace them. My only interest is to try to work with them someday, I’m not in it for glory or anything like that, just the satisfaction of doing something I’d love to do and helping improve treatment for people out there!I’m not sure if this is allowed, but I have a related question.  Do people with schizophrenia ever develop voices that are encouraging or kind or at least positive?  Or does the disorder’s correlation/link to depression and anxiety sort of necessitate that the voices be negative?[removed]Not schizophrenic (that I know of), but experienced a lot of these symptoms first hand after being sleep deprived and on a number of different substance. Let me tell you, it's pretty jarring. Everyone's used to internal voices but to hear someone say something to you clear as day, someone that isn't there and doesn't exist, it's a trip (not literally).I noticed just recently and so did I!About the time I began to think Donald Trump was the president.I have a few of the same things happen to me,please God don't let me be schizophrenic. I always hear music that isn’t there, ever since I can remember. It’s almost as if it’s really distant, but the better way to describe is that it’s very small. It sounds small, like a little band playing right by my ear. Always the same tune, although I couldn’t ever hum or repeat it, elusive and small. I hear it through earplugs and dead silence.

Always the being watched feeling too. I’m undiagnosed, because my doctor refuses to test me, and I’m too scared to push, he doesn’t believe me when I’ve told him things about my mental health in the past. So maybe it isn’t that, or maybe it is.Most of these people that are answering do not have schizophrenia. Having hallucinations does not equate to having schizophrenia. Lots of people have hallucinations for a variety of reasons. Folks that have schizophrenia not only have “positive” symptoms like hallucinations or paranoia, the symptoms that are often the most profound are the “negative” symptoms.   Symptoms like poor executive functioning, disorganization, intellectual disability, poor hygiene, inability to socialize.  In other words, the majority of schizophrenics could not get their shit together to have the complex skills to operate a reddit account.  You guys were probably misdiagnosed by a lazy mental health provider. I know I don't have schizophrenia, but one time a few years ago i was sitting in a place with a lot of background noise with some friends. We were chatting, hanging out, when all of a sudden I heard a woman say my name. It was clear as day, a whisper that played over all that noise.

my butthole spoke to me in punholes. most egregious.I would have schizophrenic episodes from around 21 I got rid of it in 6 months but it starts off as a voice telling you what to feel and then to insomnia like something's forcing you to stay up then all kinds of crazy things start happening but what I realized schizophrenic is a fake illness when it's actually demon possession.[removed]I wasn't diagnosed but I'm very very sure it was schizophrenia.    

Very first time was about 1 week before 'the trigger' which started the whole thing. I felt awkward. Restless like I were craving for a drug. Can't really describe. Also a weird feeling for my body. Never had this that intense and never again.[removed][removed]I had one of those Bob Marley Flags in my room.  At first it just seemed like music came from behind the flag, like I had an extra speaker.  

Eventually Bob kept singing when I turned the music off. 

I also see a lot of deer when I’m driving.  I know they aren’t real because I live in Las Vegas and we don’t have Desert deer.  They are not like mirages, they seem real, but they only happen when I’m tired.

Sometimes I see arrows in the sky.  They criss cross in different directions.  I’ve spent some time following them but they never go anywhere.  

Similar to that I can also get CSI vision.  I can see glowing footprints where people have been.  I’ve followed them to but never caught up to the person.

Once when I was 16, I talked with “the dark”.  Just the abstract concept of nighttime.  It was shitty.  I’m in my 30’s now and don’t see anything except the deer and the arrows.
[removed]Not me but my friend answer:


Exactly the same with my schizoaffective friend (they change the diagnosis from OCD+depression+GAD to schizoaffective and back all the time). Went into a clinic with a major depressive episode, ended up with a paranoid breakdown, felt followed, poisoned, etc. It was triggered by a text she got while in the clinic. She currently suffers from mild halluzinations (moving walls), but it could be the meds. She was able to get down to two meds (1 antidepressant + abilify, pipamperone as needed) and doesn't need Zyprexa anymore. She seems to do a lot better, so I hope it stays that way.
It all started with a depressive episode when she was 16. She started ruminating about the meaning of life, the universe etc. and got crippling suicidal thoughts and lost all interest in anything. She had short episodes where she felt all motivated as well, but I don't know if it classifies as manic/hypomanic. As a child she showed ADHS and Aspie tendencies.

She is a great, intelligent human, I absolutely love her. I really hope she will continue to feel better and better and not suffer from too many side effects due to the meds.

Source: we have a close relationship, met in the clinic (I was there for a different reason, not schizophrenia). Talk on a daily basis and often share the depths of our illnesses.


[Apart from my primary diagnosis, I suffer from irrational magical thoughts (or, actually, I don't suffer...). "If I am able to hold my breath for so and so long, something good will happen" and the like. Reading how many people had this as an early symptom makes me feel a bit uneasy. :D
I'm 25 and currently in CBT, I hope we catch it early on in case it develops into something more serious. I've had this for all my life, I guess it's my brain's need to try to control something I couldn't as a child. (Obligatory bad childhood, of course.)]What's frustrating for me is that schizoaffective disorder and schizophrenia run in my family. I always feel the presence of someone else in the room even if I'm alone, I constantly have audio hallucinations, less often I have visual hallucinations, and the list goes on. I talked to a psychologist about it, and she said that all of that is fairly normal and I'm fine. I'm glad you're doing well, and I'm glad that you're able to talk to us about it.I have a previous bipolar diagnosis as well and have been wondering if I should go get checked up soon for the some of the same things you're speaking of. Is it worth it?> Then I started seeing things. Just little things at first. Bugs crawling on the wall or flying around in the corner of my eye. I would think I saw people and then I'd focus on them and there would be nothing there. Mostly standing on sidewalks while I was driving, which was fun.


Yo I have this a lot too, but only when it's dark and my vision isn't 100%. I'll sometimes see spiders while I'm lying in bed and when I'm walking trough a dark/dim area I see people/figures in the corner of my eyes, but when I look at it it's like the back of my mind just imagined it. Certain shapes, like my chair with some clothes hanging over it, can really fuck me up too in the dark, because my brain tries to make something out of the shapes and 90% of the time it turns into something scary as fuck. My imagination is sometimes fucking with me so badly I absolutely hate darkness.Wow, this is really similar to my experience including originally being diagnosed with bipolar. How long do your mood symptoms last? Mone are generally very short but intense. The shortness is making them debate if its schzA or just schzdo you mind sharing what meds you have found work best?I know you said it started with a bipolar diagnosis as a teenager but were there anything you did as a kid that you look back on and see that there were signs there as well? I read another comment in here about a guy's brother being bipolar and feeling "empty." I have also had these moments where i think i see some small thing, like a bug, out of the corner of my eye, but it's not there. I've had other things happen as well but they could be nothing. How do you know when to go see someone (especially if you have very little to no time to do so)? That sounds frightening. Glad to hear you are keeping it under control.Holy fuck I think I may have this...what do I do?> I used to see hands snaking over the backs of furniture, like couches or bed

Ugh.

I wonder how how many horror movie scenes are inspired by "real" hallucinations.Wow that sounds really terrifying. Glad you are doing better.Hands are common for me. In the comment I had posted on here I described them too. For me the visuals happens far more frequently at night. The hands will burst out of doors, pantries, drawers, laundry baskets, anything with some form of opening really, and theyll spring out to about mid forearm reaching for anything and will go limp and dangle there when nothing fills their grasp. Holy shit dude, pretty sure i would have gone insane in a few months of that.This is ridiculously interesting. Your brain is triggering a fear and it's not repeating something you've heard. This isn't a memory it is digging up. This is a fear trigger from a hard wired fear. Humans are hard wired to be rattled by a growl or small but noticed visual clues like a hand or a head peaking. Your brain is just activating those little hard wired fears. So very interesting. Not for you though I'm sure. For you it just feels like a real threat that you are scared of. Sorry if it sounds like I'm making light of your problem. I really do feel bad for you but the ailment is tremendously interestingDamn that sucksThe BRAIN is wider than the sky...That is the scariest thing I've read on this thread. Well done, sir or madam.Are the hallucinations staying even when you look at them or do they disappear?hmmm... now I'm wonder if I have this...[removed]Very interesting story. If you don't mind, are you still on medication? And do you think your studies/life are still affected currently? Did your schizophrenia harm your chances of being accepted into med school? Has it made med school more difficult in any way?

I ask because I have a schizophrenic family member and my mom used to tell me that if I were ever diagnosed, I could never be a doctor. Your comment is the first I've ever heard of a schizophrenic doctor. And I'm still at the age where schizophrenia can show up, so I worry about my future sometimes. I'm curious now what do you call a stereotypical walk? As a fellow schizophrenic I was very clumsy as a kid, so I've got that and my aunt said I walked leaned forward, and on the sides of my feet a bit, is that what you mean or is there some other kind of walk?I'm a teacher, and had a particularly interesting experience in Teacher's College 8 years ago. We were doing a case study for a student psychology course, and were asked to try to identify an issue with a child, around the age of 12. His challenges were:

* he had recently started hearing noises/voices coming from outside the room he was in
* he'd travelled to visit his grandmother in Africa the previous year. Upon return, she'd become ill and passed away, and he blamed himself for her death because he'd been so happy to see her. He generally believed he had influence on things that he in no way, shape, or form could actually control
* he had trouble controlling his thoughts

I immediately thought schizophrenia, but then I vehemently argued the diagnosis when our teacher confirmed that it was a case of early onset. The reason is because so many of his symptoms mimicked some of the issues I had also had at that age.

Just a few examples of what I used to do:

* I was convinced that the devil was trying to get my to sell him my soul, and I was terrified that I would do so accidentally. This issue caused me considerable sleep depravation. Pretty much anytime I was alone with my thoughts, this is what I was dealing with, this pervasive thought, "I'll sell my soul no I won't I'll sell my soul no I won't I'll sell my soul no I won't" etc. etc.
* I believed that I had influence/control over things I had no control over. If I wanted something too much, or was too excited for something, it would specifically not happen
* Like you, I used to walk a very specific way, making sure I never stepped on any cracks, and, preferably, stepped with my left foot first

Interestingly, at some point I just sort of... grew out of it. While I suppose I'm not a shining beacon of mental health, I'm not too bad. I don't pay attention to the way I walk. I certainly don't believe that there's an external force trying to steal control of my soul from me. Although I suppose I did learn to temper my expectations/anticipations, just because it's not so good to become disappointed when things don't work out. 

I do suspect that, had I been closely observed as a kid, I might have been diagnosed with all kinds of things. Including possibly early onset schizophrenia.

**Edited to add:** Seems like a lot of people are suggesting OCD as being more in-sync with my childhood symptoms. I suppose that might fit. Point is, it may have fit for the case study kid, too. I wonder, if he was diagnosed early onset schizophrenic, and given medication to manage his symptoms, how did that medication effect him chemically? 

In any case, as an adult I'd say I don't particularly exhibit OCD behaviours. I do a few things that I consider OCD (mostly related to the way, as a teacher, that I manage student behaviour and deal with incidents in class). I'm a stickler for following routines, but primarily because I'm highly disorganized by nature and, if I don't have a routine, I'd lose shit all the time. 

A bit of backstory as to why I had my little breakdown as a kid: I was a tween. My mother had remarried and moved us about 300 miles away from home. I became incredibly awkward and shy. I think that, in general, I was just really, really stressed out, and that's the way I "managed" my stress. I had serious sleep issues that persisted into adulthood. I wouldn't say *insomnia,* but I would have a lot of anxiety at bedtime. I used to be terrified of being the last awake person in my household, so, obviously, I would be most nights. I think that the lack of sleep, coupled with having to get up insanely early to get to school on time (5:30AM) resulted in the issues I experienced in terms of the "sell my soul" shit. 

As for the rest of it - my anticipation influences reality, walking over cracks, etc. - who knows. Maybe it was OCD. I guess I'm lucky that it went away with puberty. I'm generally happy with my mental health as an adult.

**Second Edit** A handful of people have read my account and said, basically, "huh, this sounds like me, I always thought I had OCD or something, but maybe I have schizophrenia..." 

Guys! The whole point of my story is that I had those symptoms and I ***don't have schizophrenia!*** I probably had some stress-induced OCD tendencies that I outgrew as I learned how to manage my stress. I am a 38 year old adult with a stable job and family who has *never been on any kind of medication.* There's nothing wrong with me, and even if you are experiencing some of the symptoms I described, at worst you probably have some OCD tendencies! Thanks for reading!interesting to read about the balance issues with this. my son is currently being assessed for psychosis and has been diagnosed with dyspraxia. From a very young age he mentioned seeing people that weren't there. but weren't scary. But in last couple years he experiences a young girl standing in his room just watching him. but she has no eyes. even when she's not there he feels like he's being watched. hes started using stickers to cover tiny holes because he believes he's being watched. Has started hearing two extra voices in his head that argue and one tells him to do bad things the other to do good. if he shows any fear towards the girl in his room she starts to smile and slowly move towards him. He also sees her in his peripheral vision when facing a wall to sleep. 

Since he's turned 14 things seem to be escalating. He also has a lot of sensory issues his whole life. My younger brother has schizophrenia but I'm hoping it isn't the same thing. Sadly my brother become an alcohol and drug user to cope.>I'm in med school now and a bit nervous about my psychiatry rotation actually, because I know patients in the public system aren't always treated with dignity.

EMT student here. That unit in emergency response made me feel awful. About 3 years ago, I began hearing voices regularly and having intense intrusive thoughts. I was diagnosed with anxiety, OCD and depression, but my therapist wanted to place me on a schizophrenia watch as some of my symptoms resembled schizophrenia. 

We were in class one day going over psychiatric emergencies when someone recommended that we watch a few videos about what someone with schizophrenia hears and feels. I was already uncomfortable as the general impression of people with psychiatric problems was "these people are crazy". They started putting the videos on and I had to bail out until they were done. The videos reminded me of the voices I heard and I was scared that I would have an episode in the middle of class. When I came back, I had a few people ask me if I was alright (apparently I was pale). A few other students asked me if I was "one of the crazies". Fortunately, a group had my back and they backed off. 

The people who asked me that later failed the course (unrelated to this incident).Just remember: dignity and self-worth.[deleted]Do you have a link to this study? Or remember the name or authors? Interested in reading it How would they walk?> I'd turn on the television, and somebody would say something on the sitcom that matched up exactly with what I was thinking, like we were having a conversation. I'd open a book and there would be a very specific message that seemed like too much of a coincidence.

Great description, that bit specifically really encapsulates one of the hardest to explain yet most influential aspects of schizophrenia. I don't have schizophrenia but I've had very similar experiences from drug-induced psychosis; once during an amphetamine binge I had a period where I interpreted the drop of any EDM song as being some super important revelation of information. About that last bit. Empathy can make your job as a physician more emotionally taxing, but it *really* makes a difference to the patients, *especially* of you can "speak to them on their level" and thereby *properly* explain to them what all's going on.

I bet that you'll be really helpful to those people when that time comes.Any prof spouted some nonsense so far with regards to schizophrenia? Personally, I believe we need more people in the world like you. (Warning, long post ahead)

I was taken from my mother at two adopted at 4 by my only foster parents. Adoptive mom ALWAYS seemed to hate me. I was always having trouble. I was a social outcast, by 14 I embraced it. Was institutionalized a few times (Two mental hospitals, one runaway home), ended up in a group home for 6 months and BACK in fostercare because my adoptive mom didn't want me and adoptive dad and new wife and kids were SEVERELY abusive.

Fast forward to a few months ago. I heard the same psychiatric disorder twice in a week that I had never heard of. As a psych major (Going back for a master's in forensic psychology in February) I naturally had to look into it to learn more. 

It was like getting hit by a train. EVERY SINGLE SYMPTOM matched me for as long as I could remember, child version AND adult version.

I had/have reactive attachment disorder. Since then I have been having a kind of crisis. All my MAJOR problems that have affected my life could have been prevented but my adoptive mom didn't get me the treatment. It's not like other mental illnesses that you are predisposed to (Yours, and MANY of mine, Bipolar, ADHD, OCD to name a few) It was a completely preventable disorder and no one, for fucking 25 years noticed it EXCEPT ME. I have been seeing doctors since I was 2. I was prescribed Ritalin and overdosed around that time. I was on Adderall XR for years. I was in and out of doctors offices changing my meds because they never worked properly.

I am TEXTBOOK reactive attachment disorder and nobody paid enough attention to me or my history to notice it. It angers me. And I have no one to talk to about it because no one understands. All I ever get is fake sympathy.

I am sorry for ranting though. I hope with EVERY fiber of my being that you can help someone. I want to help people too, I don't want ANYONE to live through what I have. Good luck, I sincerely mean it. :)I don't have hallucinations, but I have pretty severe paranoia and other negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Diagnosis has varied wildly. Antipsychotics help the paranoia but I can't stand the side effects.

The interesting thing is that the symptoms coincide with my gut. When I'm constipated I have severe depression, paranoia, withdrawal, anhedonia, and don't speak. I use an enema and all symptoms are cured in minutes. It's like flipping a switch. I've gone from unable to leave the house because I thought everyone was staring at me, to feeling absolutely no anxiety or depression whatsoever...as soon as an enema was administered.

I also sometimes get euphoric when my gut switches from constipated to diarrhea. Not manic...just really happy. Coming from someone who's suicidal moments before the diarrhea starts, I thought this was weird. I recognized the distinct feeling of MDMA, but I had been clean of all drugs for years. I knew it was a sudden flood of serotonin.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21056283

Turns out people with mixed IBS have high tryptophan when it's with diarrhea and low tryptophan with constipation. But what amazed me was that the paranoia was cured so totally and instantly. I'm still unable to get a diagnosis for any of my physical or mental symptoms...the diagnosis depends on the doctor. I'm afraid I'll probably just have to live with them for the rest of my life, unable to work or function on my own. But at least I've found something that works...for whatever reason.Congrats on your achievements! I think your patients will be very inspired and happy to learn that individuals with a similar diagnosis and mental health history can become whatever they want, just like anyone else. Feeling flat? I’ve always had this sudden feeling come over me while walking that im was now inverse and inside out and now my knees and elbows bend the opposite way even though I continue moving forward. Even my face feels inverted like popping a mask inside outWhen you talked about it been common with people with Autism, what do you mean? I have no idea what this would be (highly doubt it's schizophrenia but can’t say it’s not a possibility, but I do doubt it) but a lot of the time, I feel like a "thing" is watching me. It’s much worse at night, mainly because I don’t have light to reassure me, but often I feel like there is something in my room just standing there watching me, waiting to kill me or something.

I don’t really know how to describe it, but I often feel like there is something just out of sight, like behind me. Sometimes I have this feeling like there is a demon (not that I am not religious) or something right behind me about to strike or has its hand just above me. You know the feeling of knowing something is there but not knowing what or where. Well it’s like that but just about everyday, not just when it’s at night but when it is night, pretty much all the time.

I have a lot of examples of this and things similar to it, does this sound like anything along the lines of what you describe relating to Autism? Also what do you mean by walking "funny" on tiles?

Really sorry for sounding really stupid if it is. I have just really needed to talk about this to someone and am too scared to talk to anyone in real life.Great description of your symptoms. I really appreciated reading your post.
Best of luck with med school!  Nursing student with BP2 here - I did my psych rotation at a state hospital and was pleasantly surprised at how humanely the clients were treated on an inpatient basis.  I hope you have a similar experience.  It seems to be the outpt system that is the bigger failure.Autist here. I poop at least 3 times a day. If it's less than that I know that it will be so for a few days and then I'll poop like 8 times. 

My record is 11 or 12, I think.> I found lots of tiny pieces of paper stuck on my bedroom wall and when I drew closer to read them, they'd divide by 2. When I went even closer, they'd divide by 2 again. So I could never read what was written on them.

This is super interesting to me as I experience this same kind of thing every time I've taken LSD. Not the paper part but just words written everywhere that you can see but can't actually read as they just divide up. Makes me wonder if it's activating a similar part of the brain"Walk in a stereotypical fashion." 

Can you explain further? 
There seem to be many videos about abnormal gaits on YouTube but I can't seem to find one that is about schizophrenia directly.yes thank you for bringing up negative symptoms!!!!!!! I always find them a lot worse than positive and they aren't talked about so anyone who thinks because they hear their name being said out of nowhere once in a while they've got full blown schizophrenia. 

the gut thing is interesting. my psych team/s have always been very iffy about my diagnostics, but I was technically diagnosed with PDD-NOS (an autistic spectrum disorder) back when that was still a thing and I do get psychosis too- this is fascinating because I've also got anorexia that is very difficult to get help for because eating any food at all causes me immense physical distress. I've also got slight gastroparesis. I'm going to look into this.I did the whole "walk this way and nothing will happen to your mom." All the way up until I was in highschool. I would repeatedly turn on and off the light switch  over and ever until I was satisfied with it too. IDK what happened...I just kinda magically abandoned those habits after doing them for probably about 10 years as a child. I can't say I really have any strong urges to do stuff like that to protect my family and friends from imminent disaster,but I clearly remember having trouble with the same exact stuff for the same reasons.Hmmm interesting. Part of this sounds a little like folie a deux. Did you notice any improvement in symptoms after moving out of your moms home?>The children tended to be clumsier and walk in a stereotypical fashion. Not surprising since the motor system is neurological.

I believe I read somewhere that lack of dopamine is a big player in diseases like Schizophrenia, which can have an affect on motor skills.I’m a fourth year med student applying for Psychiatry. I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression since I was a little kid so I can empathize with your fears (I’m on a better med regiment now and starting to become more stable). If you ever need advice or just want to talk, I’m always available. The ol’ “step on a crack break your mothers back”Can someone explain anhedonia to me? Can it be painful/unpleasant??
>The gut system (enteric nervous system) is also neurological, and has been implicated in schizophrenia and more commonly developmental disorders like autism.

Do you think vaginal birth and/or breast feeding can mitigate some of this? Additionally, perhaps encouraging more play in the dirty and mud as our gut flora are closest to soil?I had very similar delusionsUh oh...

These symptoms look reaaaally familiar to me. Should I look for help?It really makes you curious with the “prevalence and epidemic” of ASD how many kids were misdiagnosed prior? The reason being the symptoms are very similar; social impairment,  lack of eye contact, stereotypical behaviors, dyspraxia (that walk your speaking of), ocd etc... I mean the sensory processing/modulation disorder and gastro too. 
I did my masters research on sensory intervention (unfortunately our results were just correlational & inconclusive due to controls); in our lit review individuals with schizophrenia had demonstrated significant functional improvement  in a snoezeleon. Sensory research is pretty new, but I mean the negative symptoms alone at that age can really impact development.. if they can’t interact with their environment how do we expect them to be able to process it later? if you treat someone with a dx at the age of 10, do you treat their “schizophrenia” or do you treat the child? Just food for thought I guess. I work in a psychiatric hospital. It's easy to get burned out by psychotic people, but even if it seems like the workers are ragging on them, just realize that they are still choosing to work there. They want to help, they care about the patients. It's just really hard sometimes.That's weird because I don't have schizophrenia but I can't walk on paths without a certain pattern, it's kinda weird but I hate to walk on anything with lines on it including like imaginary lines This is a really interesting comment, thanks for sharing.

Ps could somehow guess you were Aussie by your style of writing. :DThanks I needed this. I'm at a crossroads in my life, where I was backing out of my goal of psychiatry... How's med school? I can't wait to get in. Oh man I so want to sit and have a beverage with you and just listen to you talk about sciencey stuff Do you have a source or remember anything about how to find that study with the videos?Do you ever worry that, when you become a doctor, your mental condition might cause you to do something that would hurt the patient? Like hear a voice that tells you to give then a certain medicine. I hear that you can't always identify the hallucinations. So do you think it's possible that you might hallucinate something that would hurt your patient?
This is really interesting! I don't want to try and make any claims, but are hallucinations of those sorts similar to psychedelic hallucinations from medication or drugs? When I read the things that you recalled as early triggers, I realized they happen in my life pretty often, sometimes more and sometimes less. When they do happen, I always think it's either because I am really tired or having a slight flashback to a psychedelic drug I had taken in the past.> because I know patients in the public system aren't always treated with dignity

This is one of the same reasons I have returned to school. Thank you.I usually feel the same thing about someone on the tv saying something a person or me said moments before. Also with books and on the radio. Does it still happen to you?This sounds a lot like experiences I've had with taking hallucinogenic mushrooms when I was younger. Man, I was scared as hell and won't ever take again. Glad to hear you are successful in spite of it.Can you link to the paper?  I'm very interested in the predictive motor and ambulatory aspects.When you mentioned how stuff just matches up to what you are thinking (tv sitcom convo) and messages in pages that seemed too much of a coincidence, are there any other examples of this happening in your life, because I’m really intrigued about this stuff and would also like to hear about studied cases about this, and how something like this works. Is it like, to you, something supernatural just happened and it’s scary to think about? Or is it really just the brain playing tricks on you? Sorry about the bluntness; I’ve been really wanting to find out more about this kind of thing. >The children tended to be clumsier and walk in a stereotypical fashion.

What does this walk look like?I'm not sure if it's for similar reasons chemically, but like your walking was dictated by a delusion, when doctors would run casual tests on me while I was catatonic - moving my arm & seeing if it stayed up in the air where they put it - I 100% had hallucinations specifically explaining to me why I couldn't move. Motor stuff is medically observable, but I've come to believe that the motor symptoms are chemically initiated, and chemistry that produces hallucinations and delusions play catch-up, creating a plot to make things make sense to the patient. It'll happen super quick - the plot of your illness will rush at you - but this is one way for the average person to consider how complex and powerful the human brain is, that it's capable of creating a reality in which one's physical abnormalities are rapidly fictionalized.How does one feel flat? > The gut system (enteric nervous system) is also neurological, and has been implicated in schizophrenia and more commonly developmental disorders like autism.

Wait, what's that about autism? Where can I learn more? This is going to sound stupid, but could my diet influence my autism as an adult? To make me better or worse?> The gut system (enteric nervous system) is also neurological, and has been implicated in schizophrenia and more commonly developmental disorders like autism.

Is this why autistic people tend to have intestinal/digestive problems? This is fascinating. Thank you for sharing.> group of boys from school were laughing at me

I'd like to hear more about how schizophrenia brought you positive/negative attention from people at school.This is super late, but do you know where I might be able to find the paper you mentioned?You sound like an absolute champ btw! I believe people like you positively impact the world. Awesome read thank you.Very interesting. Most people wouldn’t let others into their mind the way you did. I think some people just don’t care about the small stuff. Seems others hold on to it for far too long. Glad you’re doing okay. > I'd turn on the television, and somebody would say something on the sitcom that matched up exactly with what I was thinking, like we were having a conversation. I'd open a book and there would be a very specific message that seemed like too much of a coincidence.

Some people might call that "divination".Schizophrenics should be sterilized. The thought of my mom being schizo and thoughtlessly introducing me into a world like that sounds extremely cruelI'm going to call bullshit on this one.The whispers were the worst for me.. and I'd hear breathing under my bed.. at its worst I felt, literally felt, something crawl up my bed and lay next to me. I started freaking out and my parents were holding me telling me no one was there. It was awful.Could this be where all the ghost stories come from??[deleted]Ever heard jabbering nonsense?

Like "Jacob made it down the building fine"

I don't know a Jacob or the building he's in. It's just the voice.That scares the shit out of me because I already have a mild mental ilness history and I thought I would get no more new shit, sad to hear you got it in college> Also saw many things as a child too.

Real?  Imagined?  Or is the line too blurry?

(i.e. "Saw things" as in abuse, or "saw things" moving around the room?)Hey, did the meds help you quickly or was it slow? Are you better now? :)
i realize now this is where stories of ghosts come from.  not just illusions or something, but straight up mental disorders in dumb uneducated people way back in the day

not saying youre dumb and uneducated of course. But what you see matches my theoryWhen I get severely sleep deprived, I start seeing shadow people and shadow animals too, complete with buzzing noises and whispering.  They stand everywhere and just stare at me, while doing arbitrary chores/actions. Every time I'm afraid that I might be susceptible to psychosis, but it goes away after I had a good rest. But that is luckily the only time ever and is interesting to me that it causes similar symptoms.

I'm sorry that you have to go through that regularly. :(How did the shadow people actually start showing up? I see just some just in the corner of my eye or thought I'd have seen them but question myself again since they are really fastI’m not schizophrenic, but I had Lyme disease for about 2-3 months in high school before we caught it.  Those sound exactly like my symptoms towards the end.  I thought I was losing my mind for a few weeks - I can’t imagine trying to live with that day to day.  I've seen the term "shadow people" show up multiple times in this thread. What does that mean? Are they veiled in shadows? Are they black silhouettes? I remember one of my friends has seen these shadow people before. Onetime I was driving him at night and he just tells me that he sees shadow figures running/walking across the street but I could never see themWhen I read “high notes of laughter” I just heard a group of people laughing out of nowhere. wtf?What do you mean by name whispers? Is it like a voice whispering random names to you? I have sleep paralysis and see shadow people/ hear noises. Now I know these two conditions aren't the same, but are there any similarities between these experiences? [removed][removed]I'm a 28 year old momwhose husband works night's.  I'm still afraid of the dark but I like to pretend im not for.my 3 year old.

Im.not sleeping tonight[removed]Fuck man, that sucks hardcore. are you doing all right now?What’s up with schizophrenia and always having negative things said? Like it’s always “jump down the stairs” or “I’m going to kill her”.

Why isn’t it ever “You look good today” or “She thinks your awesome don’t worry you got this”

 "don't worry I'm not going to kill your mom"
That's exactly what a mom killer would say.../r/WholesomeSpaceUnderYourBedThat's a very specific thing to not do space under my bed!I would have noped the fuck out of there.> don't worry I'm not going to kill your mom

Well...thats one less thing to worry about.
My space throws parties! There's always mumbling, like a crowd of people talking from under the floor. Never anything coherent. Just background noise.What did the voice sound like? Mans voice,  woman’s voice, scary voice, childs voice etc...?I really shouldn't have opened this thread, God I knew something like this was going to get to me.Holy shit. That'd make me cry I'm sorry you experienced that, but must admit, it's a morbidly funny line. Hope you're better now.well fuck i'm not gonna be able to sleep tonight"Don't worry, I'm not going to kill your mom." 

Thank you, I guess?I have super creepy hallucinations right when I’m going to sleep sometimes...  I once found a medical term for it but I don’t have the kind of brain that remembers medical terms.  Essentially I see things in my room that aren’t there.  When they finally disappear, it’s as if I’ve been awake all the time

I’ve never had any audible ones but if I did they would *definitely* sound like thisHuh, I had similar experiences when I was a little kid. Would find myself talking to "tiny people" that lived down the gap between my bed and my wall. Like, I could actually see action figure sized humans under my bed, talking to me at night. I can't remember if it was a dream I had or if I was imagining things, from what I can remember it all seemed pretty real to me. Last time it happened I was maybe 7ish? Haven't had any similar experiences since then. I am 17 now. Can someone tell me why so many of the replies to this post are removed?“Only your dad”Holy shit. That must have been terrifying. I mean at that age your imagination is in overdrive and you don't always know what is real or how the world operates. My sons are that age and they still believe in Santa Claus. Compound the normal fears and rampant imagination with legitimate hallucinations. That sucks, OP!This is amazing prose. I love it. Sorry about its truth but those lines are gorgeous.Holy hell that must have been terrifying! How did you react to that voice? And othersOf course not. Thats your job. 


:0Bz. Jn. I cc   sx.x. M. MbSo I have the most insane recollection of this happening to me at a friends sleepover... also I used to cry about people yelling bad things in my ear at night, in 22 and still can’t lay in bed without covering my ears... my dad used to complain of the same thing and is a diagnosed with bipolar and depression as far as I’m aware.... shitHave you gotten better? Does it still happen?[deleted and removed]> "don't worry I'm not going to kill your mom"

How reassuring.AwUnder The Bed is a no from me. Always had been. I just slap that mattress right on the floor. I've heard juvenile schizophrenia is pretty rare.  That's a rough trait to have at that age.  :(You ruined meh night[deleted]That's too early for schizophrenia. You're either lying or suffer from some other mental disorder. "There's always someone watching."
This.  Since I was very young I have had this sensation.  All of my thoughts are being monitored in some way.  My private thoughts are public somehow, so self policing my mind was one of my 'fixes'.  My intrusive thoughts never seemed 'outside' of me, but many of my paranoid delusions still exist.  They never go away, but I have learned to limit the amount of influence they have on me.  Many of my thoughts are beneficial as well, kind of like a super brutal coach.  Not polite and soothing, but in many cases accurate.

EDIT: No, this one symptom does NOT mean you have schitzophrenia.  Yes, this is a common experience for many people.  If it does not control your life, change your behavior, make you afraid then it is NOT A PROBLEM FOR YOU, and I'm glad to hear it.Wait what? I hear things constantly and have for years. There’s always a TV on or I’ll hear a man talking, but I’ll ask whoever’s around and they don’t hear anything. The shadow people I’ve seen following my car while driving, but I just attributed that to being tired from a long trip. And as far back as I can remember I’ve thought there was someone in the vent watching or cameras in the vents. This freaks me out. I hear random sounds all the time when I shouldn’t. I hear my cat meowing at school or someone calling my name when something turns on. The worst is when I’m alone and I hear breathing. Like right now. 
That’s right, Satan, I can hear you. Back off, bitch. 
I think that’s all pretty normal. That happens to everyone. It’s still weird to think about.  I've been having paranoid intrusive thoughts about cameras for maybe like 2 years now, and now I think I might be a little nervous about itOh man, background noise, music, shadow people and a lot of it happening when driving - I'm not schizophrenic (I don't think, anyway) but I had some pretty bad hypnogogia when I was younger and that's all awfully familiar.

Thankfully I skipped the camera bit. Hallucinations I can handle, and could occasionally be entertaining (when they weren't horrible) once I realized I was prone to them, but actual paranoia would have been horrible.

I was convinced at one point there was an animal under the floor under my bed, but it turned out that a crab had gotten into the sump pump vents so I didn't even hallucinate that one! I thought I was really going crazy, glad I checked the next day.This worries me. I hear these things ALL THE TIME, like right now. Banging, a weird hum, ticking, stomping on my ceiling and sometimes a distant female voice sounding like it’s coming from a loooong vent with fan slowly chopping up the noise.

My parents were visiting and I complained about all the noise and they just kind of looked at me in very scared way and said “What noise? are you feeling ok?”.  It really shocked them.

This is something that’s only started to happen in the past 5ish months and now I’m hearing it in more places and more often.

I’m trying to convince myself it’s sleep related.

But now I’m becoming terrified that I’m losing my mind.The whole random noises and sounds thing scares me because for years I've randomly hear a distinctive ticking sounds that I've never been able to figure out, this has happened for years in different places but I kind of assume that it's just a sound most houses will have.Oh shit, it never occurred to me that the music I hear playing when I'm trying to get to sleep isn't real. It's really quiet and indistinct, though, so it doesn't bother me. That camera paranoia sound like the most annoying thing  to deal with. Occasionally I get the sense I'm being watched and it's so unpleasant, dealing with that constantly must suck. I have a lot of sympathy for that.[deleted]I don't think I'm schizophrenic, but the camera thing is really relatable. When I'm at work I feel like everything I do is being watched on camera even though it's a small business and there are no cameras. When I'm housesitting I feel like I'm on camera. If I don't cover my webcam on my computer it feels like people are watching me.

I also get this feeling that people can hear my thoughts if I'm thinking about them in public. If I start thinking about someone who is near me, I start making all kinds of random noises in my head to stop the thoughts so they can't hear them.I have the shadow people while driving. Freaks me the fuck out I am always on edge I will hit and kill someone. I hear doors opening, people walking in my attic, phones ringing. I am undiagnosed and unmedicated. Seeing shadow people has been a thing since I was 8ish. Sometimes they are inside, but I mostly see them while driving. I also have a voice telling me to run people over. Its not a strong voice but its more than just an intrusive thought.

I also am sure people are watching me. I am bugged and there are cameras everywhere watching my every movement. I tell myself I am uninteresting and worthless so no one would do that to help. 

My symptoms are not external. No one knows. I think people pick up there is something off about me but can not pin point it. I have no friends because of it as well..What's it like seeing something that's not there? Is it literally like there's someone in front of you, or more like a dream where your brain kind of fills in or glosses over details?Hang on. The cameras thing. I feel that, but I've never told anyone. Couldn't that just be paranoia?Now you're scaring me into thinking I'm schizophrenicI'm bipolar II rather than schizophrenic, but since I was a little kid I was always extremely paranoid that someone was watching me or filming me from anything reflective. When I went to the bathroom I had to cover every piece of metal that was reflective or I couldn't handle it. That's the big thing that sticks out in my memory from like 7 years old until I got to around 13 and it wasn't reflective things so much as a hidden eye. That's the best way I can explain how the thought comes to me. The thing that also started to hit me later was that people can read my thoughts. I know that they would probably be too practiced to show it once I'm aware of it and they know I'm aware of it. I can logic my way out of it almost but I'm still left with that horrible paranoia of "what if..."Maybe I shouldn’t have opened this thread. Is there a point that it’s something to be concerned about as long as the paranoia doesn’t present? 

I am paranoid but it’s very specific. But I often hear things that aren’t there. I sleep with white noise. I have deep anxiety as well so I always point my extras to that. fuck. this sounds like me. I've been to several doctors, one today even. I just keep getting a depression diagnosis. I thought since they weren't voices or full people than it wasn't schizophrenia.

I hear stomping all the time. And the shadow people, they're almost like "seeing something out of the corner of your eye" but they linger. Not long enough for detail, but unmistakable.> That and the stupid cameras. Always assume a room has a camera. In the vents usually. There is always someone watching.

This kind of hits home. I went through a long period as a teenager in which I was absolutely, totally certain that my sister and my parents had both installed camera systems so that they could watch me at all times. It never occurred to me to ask them about it, because I didn't think they'd tell me if they had anyway. I'd forgotten that until now. I get that too. I'm upstairs in bed & I hear the TV on downstairs. Or people talking to me. But the TV's off & I'm alone. Then every since I was a kid a woman's whisper wakes me up & I jolt up in bed. It's indiscernible, just one word, a quiet whisper. Doesn't really freak me out because it's happened since I was a kid. I've basically decided the latter is just hypnagogic or whatever it's called. The former I've chalked up to paranoia or psychosis or who the fuck knows.Ok I hear music, not like anything that is specific or relavent. It's mostly Victorian symphonies or sometimes a very old song, and I always check to see if something is doing it, never isCan you work ? I mean that respectfully.When I was a kid, I used to think that every fly or other suspecious spec was a camera, and that the people at school were watching me so they could make fun of me. Thus, I ended up being socially distant for a long time. What happens if I can relate to everything you described?

Sometimes I hear a phone ringing in my room but there is no phone. 

Sometimes I hear my name being called but no one is there. 

I always stare at vents and sometimes even give them the finger in case there’s a camera. 

I’ve suffered from sleep paralysis and seeing people out of the corner of my eyes who are there...

I always wonder if I’m gonna insane...
Your post just gave me chills. I have experienced a lot of auditory hallucinations in the past 2 years. They got so bad at one point that I was genuinely terrified that there was a person or multiple people in my house. I've never actually heard like a conversation or words, but I could hear the low hum of vocal chords, much like your parents talking quietly in the next room and you can hear the natural rise and falls of words. I could hear footsteps all the time, and occasionally someone touching the (very loose) handle on my bedroom door. I woke my husband up way too many times to search the house and check the locks.

At one point I was visiting my grandparents and mentioned to my sister that Grandpa was up watching tv really late every night. She was very confused and said he hadn't been at all, at which point I said "you can't hear the tv right now? It's so loud." She was freaked out and said there was no noise. The strange thing is how I could completely tell what was "on" the tv; a commercial, an old western or a sports channel. When I got up to check the living room, the noise actually got louder as I approached the door, like it should, but just like you it all stopped the second I opened the door. It was almost like the sound of a record scratching on my brain like "oh that's not real, better stop making it seem real". So many normal everyday sounds that don't belong.

Even when I knew it wasn't real, I still couldn't quell the immediate intense heart pounding in your ears fear that came every time. I eventually have been able to rationalize enough times that the frequency and intensity of the hallucinations decreased a ton. But it still makes you question if something is real or not. I've found that white noise, like a fan, increases the chance of hearing some thing that doesn't belong. For awhile though I really thought I was losing it.I appreciate that you took the time to write this since I found it very interesting. I hope you take care. <3This is schizophrenia? I’m honestly asking because I occasionally hear a radio playing that no one else does. For the few people that know about it I’ll just quietly say, “there’s my radio.” No one else ever heard it. 

I’ve also seen “shadow people” in the way you describe them as well. I do double takes multiple times a week, sometimes daily. 

I’m so confused now. I never put that together the there was always a tv on.. this is so correct !!!
Hmm... TIL ghosts = schizophrenia. Who knew. Do you still have all these symptoms?That sounds like experiences I see when I go without sleep for 48+ hours. The last time I did that, I once saw a shadow man having sex with a shadow woman... and it turned out to be nothing but a window curtain. I also saw a projector attached to the ceiling with a number lighting up the room. I think it said 333. I focused my eyes, squinted, and it slowly faded away and all I could see was an empty ceiling. [deleted]I used to think there were always camera's even when I'm just at home and I know there isn't anything there. I also sometimes see lights or hear random noises and I'm not sure if it's just my imagination. I ask people sometimes and sometimes they say they do sometimes they don't but I really don't know if they're trolling me or not. I don't think it has happened in a while tho so. Then again, I used to kind of want to have it because I thought it sounded cool, so I might just be doing it to myself on purpose which is weird.Are you diagnosed? I sometimes hear stuff like that, too. Is that not normal?Sometimes I play weird games in my head, like when I'm trimming my hair I have a thought that my exes are trying to control me through some hair/techno device and that I have to cut things back to a certain length/# of hairs to foil their plan.

It's just a recurring thought that I know has no basis in reality, but a lot like your symptoms its a weird thought of a false reality that comes up every time unprompted. Sometimes I engage with it more than I'm comfortable with though, like imagining an ex in a villain's layer cursing me for foiling their ingenious plot.  

I catch myself saying 'now' in my head sometimes before I touch objects, as if to force myself to pause to consider what I'm about to do. It's very very quick and you wouldn't notice it unless you knew to look but I visibly pause a lot before touching things like door knobs. It's not a germaphobic thing (I'm moderately clean but nothing particular), just a subtle tick that I've noticed developing. I also do it during uncomfortable situations: I'll say, silently, 'now now now' very fast, as it to say in an abbreviated way that I want this moment to end as soon as possible.

When I had a cat I developed ticks with her: I would recite very specific kinds of rhyming baby talk, the way you would talk to a cute animal, but it was extremely repetitive to the point that the cat passed recently and yet I still find myself reciting the rhymes to myself alone in my car, to no one in particular, the way you would sing-speak your favorite lyrics. And I think, do I miss my cat, whom I really loved, or is that crazy? Should I get a new pet?

I no longer know if all of this is normal, or if it is borderline crazy.

I used to see those shadow people after about three days awake on stimulants. Don't miss those times. I'm not schizophrenic, but radio thing happened to me once when I spent 3 days up on adderall studying for finals. 3 am in a study room on campus with nobody but me and my study partner around and I swore I heard rock music playing in the hallway. Got up and went to check and it freaked me out how I went from hearing it clearly in my head to eery silence as soon as I walked into the hall. Shadow people in the corner of my eye, lucid dreaming with threatening shadow people, hearing a talkshow on tv a couple rooms away that's not there... I told my psychiatrist all this and those symptoms coupled with my inability to properly focus on things, my anxiety, depression and a few other childhood habits and I was diagnosed with ADHD. 1 adderall (amphetamine salts) 20mgs in the morning and I'm all good. Psychiatry is such a confusing subject matter. Do you still have the camera paranoia. I had similar severe paranoia and would flip off mirrors cause I always through cameras were behind them. For years I was convinced my dogs were decvices made to spy on me. It's mellowed with age but I'm still very paranoid. Fortunately not achitzophrenic though. This guy sees dead peoplehow do you remember the details of an event which happened some years ago?What was the music on the radio playing?Hmm, I also see people crossing street, walking on the side of the road, when in fact there is no one there.Omg... I think I have many of the same symptoms Yes, the shadows too. I have one that I have affectionately called the 'Shower Lady' because I only ever saw her when I was showering. And always for just an instant, from one side to the other. First few times it was frightening. Then I sorta got accustomed to it happening every now and then, but I learned it happened most frequently when I was stressed about something.Holy crap.  I hear stuff almost every night.  Usually I'll hear songs and it sounds like they're really playing.  But I think it usually starts out by me thinking of them but then it kind of gets away from me and I hear them for real.  And it's much worse when I smoke marijuana.  I'll hear music, screaming, water running, children playing.  But I always just kind of work through it.  Did your symptoms get worse gradually?Holy fuck, my hands are shaking after reading this. I had the exact same thing happen to me (about the radio) except I was hearing people arguing. I charged through the living room and swung the front door open when two of my roommates, who were sitting on the couch, asked what I was doing and explained there were no noises. I have no doubt they would have heard it too. I’ve always noticed strange things that aren’t there and it’s gotten worse lately. Always feel as though I’m being watched I thought it was just moving into a new house. I’ll be 20 in March and this has me a little concerned now. Guess I’ll have to look into it.I used to see shadow people. Huh.I’m not schizophrenic but I have occasionally experienced auditory hallucinations since I was a child. I do the radio thing too. Granted it started when I was a kid so I though I had superpowers, and it didn’t annoy me, but it was wild to just hear a radio playing and realizing/knowing it wasn’t there. Occasionally get the same hallucinations as an adult. Never seen a doctor about them because they’re very rare and I don’t imagine it’s a problem fortunately. 

Not really a story to share but it’s interesting to see other people who have hallucinated a radio playing. I’ve never met/heard of anyone else that’s experienced that as well. I hope I’m not being disrespectful to the disease in any way, if I am do let me know. 
Never actually been diagnosed, but this is very similar to mine.  
The cameras, and whenever I'm in public, I try really hard not to think about anything because I'm paranoid that there's somebody close by that might be able to read my thoughts.I feel like I'm being watched when I'm outside. But I think it's just anxiety with a hint of paranoia.I'm fucking terrified of windows at night I always feel eyesJesus Christ Schizophrenia sounds terrifyingLike a Truman show kind of thing?This is my life.  I saw an entire construction scene outside of my window at 2:00 in the morning.  
I relate to this so much. Ive been seeing shadow people for about 15 years. But I dont hear voices/sounds or anything else like that. Sometimes reading these threads me me wonder if I am a functioning  schizophrenic. 


 So since I was a kid, I've seen the shadow people and animals. I'll hear weird shit.  Like sometime white noise, like the kind a fan makes, will sound like a person talking or music. I've had conversations with people, and they'll say things, but what I hear them say--they arent really saying. And as I was a kid, I get a nervous feeling like I am being watched. 
I just assumed it was part of my learning disorder.  It still happens occasionally as an adult. Like seeing a shadow figure. But I figured it is just my eyes reacting to light. 

When did you start seeing the shadow people? I've seen them too and even slammed on the brakes once because of it. Your hallucination accepted he wasn't real. 

Holy shit. The human mind is an interesting thing. Are you still friends with those people? How did you react when they told you now one else was there?Too much brain for your brain so your brain tried to be two. A valiant effort good brain, but you didn't quite make it.Can you describe this guy? Would you say he is similar to you in some ways? Like a fragment of your own personality just grew into human form? I hope my question isn't rude or insulting! I was just genuinely curious!72 hour paper writing bender (50 pages across three papers) topped with a work shift into friday night.  The line between reality and dream blurred quite heavily by then.  Auditory hallucinations, people coming and going. Had a few conversations that started off normally enough and then devolved into non-sequitur before I snapped awake. Got up a few times to kick strangers off the computers only to have my hand pass through them. Oddly enough pushing all the chairs in all the way seemed to stop the phantoms from manifesting.

Got home, crashed into the bed and then wondered how the hell I could wake up feeling fully refreshed but in such an achy agony after an hour of sleep. Nope, slept totally motionless for 25 hours.  Never again.Have you ever thought something that was real was imagined? For example, have you seen someone who looked out of place, and figured it was the schizophrenia working against you, but it turned out to be real? Or do you have a way of telling what is more certainly real?So you see (saw?) the same guy persistently, you just perceived him as openly admitting to be imaginary once you learned about your schizophrenia?Am severe bipolar 1. The biggest time I had auditory hallucinations it sounded like I was in a stadium full of thousands of myself and they were all shouting at me. I just laid down and cried for hours.

So is he still your buddy now?


Please say yesCan you explain more about the pschology of it and how you apply it to yourself?  I'm very interested to hear more.If I'm being too intrusive I apologise, but I'm just wondering what your friends reaction was to the discovery of you speaking to someone else? I see what you did at the end there Here I sit wondering if my friend who can see ghosts has schizophrenia but don't know it.wtf that' so scary. I know a guy who i met online trough a video game in 2012 and i still talk to him occasionally but i've never seen him irl. What if that is also made up by my mind??After that first instance did the guy stay with you and keep popping in until you accepted him? Was he there the entire time after that?Interesting. Sounds like a [Tulpa.](/r/tulpas)

There's a whole community dedicated to creating exactly this on purpose. Holy shit, this sounds like that Netflix show Sense8This isn't schizophrenia. You're making this up. Sometimes when I have a lucid dream and I'm 'interacting' with the people in the dream I put on a knowing smile because I know I'm interacting with myself and then it get's a bit creepy because something smiles back.So hes still around? Does he act like a normal person? Is he your imaginary friend?! If so,  give him my condolences!That part about having a friend with you like that sounds kind of nice.Tell us more about the guy, please.

Does he act like your friend? Does he stay alone with you sometimes or just casually appears?

It made me think of a Tulpa.Is the imaginary guy friendly?What if you push him? Do you feel him?Serious question. What did he look like? Did he change clothes like normal ppl?In early, intensive treatment, so many people told me that either I'm a prophet, or the human brain's capabilities are infinitely more complex and grand than we think of them as being.

I am not a prophet.Reminds me a bit of the Rick and Morty episode "Total Rickall". I'm curious if, at parties full of strangers, visual-heavy schizophrenics have to pick apart who's real and who's fake.Is he a chill dude you still see em? What's his name?Fuck the voices. I hear voices of people I’ve known before, do other schizophrenics ever experience that?Are the voices like invasive thoughts that sound like different people or is it an audible voice in your ear? Like someone speaking.When you say voices told you people were plotting, did you literally hear voices in your head or was it a strong feeling or suspicion? 
When did you realize that other people didn't hear voices? Why did you think that heard them?When you hear these voices, what is the automatic response – do you feel like you should believe them? Are you aware that they don’t actually exist outside of your mind, and should not be taken seriously? Do the voices sound like someone you know or have known Dash or yourself? Do they sound different than someone else talking to you saying the same things?

I am so fascinated and curious by this affliction. Thank you for your answers in advanceMy friend is schizo and he is probably the most outgoing person I know. You got to watch him though because he'll start conversations with strangers, annoy them and when they get upset he starts having a freak out. This happened on a plane once and he about got pulled off.I think I can hear ppl far away whispering and sometimes it's about me. I've jokingly confronted them a few times about what they said and they're always giving the same shocked look asking me how I was able to hear them, but it didn't escalate as I play it off friendly like. I can't tell if I have super hearing or I'm a paranoid since I've been correct about ppl talking crap about me a few times. We've had a few schizophrenia in my family, but no other signs except thinking too much/dwelling on things. Thanks for this subject either way.Curious, when you say "voices" do you mean another person in your head or do you mean the things you're just telling yourself. Could you describe what these voices sounded like?Were the voices that you heard like actual audible voices or were they more like uncontrolled thoughts running through your mind that seemed like voices?Just curious, do the voices ever tell you positive things, or just negative?I work in mental health and advice used to be to distract clients from their voices. Now newer models tell clients to interact with their voices and find our what their saying.. Would you agree with this? Challenge the voices even? Man that sucks, sorry you had to go through that. Glad youre in a better place now. 

Im curious, how clear are these voices? 
Are they almost as someones whispering into your ear or are they faint and subtle? Why do the voices always say bad things though? Where does it come from? Is it like your subconscious or something?
What are the voices like? Is it legit like you hear someone talking to you or is it more like your own internal voice? If you hear someone talking to you that isnt there how does that not raise any flags for you? Genuinely curious. Im just thinking if i heard some random voice i would immediately be  concerned and not actually trust it.I had a teacher once in highschool want to talk about the importance of understanding different types of mental health disorders. She ended up getting a bunch of societies from around the area to come in and present about the disorder they worked with to help remove stigma from it. The one I always remember is the one involving schizophrenia as they were explaining what audible hallucination were and what they were like. 

They did an example, I, being the teen that loved to participate in class, ended up being the person with "schizophrenia" in a skit about having a job interview. The presenter asked me a question typical of a job interview and then there were four people behind me that were instructed to read off pre-written script while I tried to respond to the questions the interviewer. 

I never realized quicker how hard life could be with audible hallucinations before that. At one point I started laughing really hard because someone was using a really weird voice. The presenter when on to talk about why it's common for with that have schizophonia to laugh at bad times etc.  I feel like I have thoughts like this but I never hear any voices. I can never tell if I'm crazy or if I'm weird.How do you differentiate between paranoia caused by your schizophrenia and just general human paranoia?The mind is a delicate place. This is me right now. I know I'm developing  schizophrenia, I definitely have paranoid personality disorder. I'm a musician in college and ive kinda learned to use this in a positive way, even though there are plenty of negatives. Pretty sure I'm bi polar though, ive talked to my doctor and one of the reasons I'm.not on medicine is because I don't have hallucinations! I hear voices for sure and I def always think people are talking about me. But I feel like I tapped into an entirely new creative outlet. I could talk about what its like for me for hours lol. My environment me  being adopted and growing up in a family of 13!
I’ve always been curious about those voices. What do those voices sound like? Does it sound familiar? Or is it your own voice? Or something different entirely?I mean this as a genuine question, and I hope it comes off that way: How do you differentiate your own thoughts from voices that you hear? At what point did you figure out that it was other voices rather than self-defeating thoughts of your own?

I'm sorry that you have to deal with this, and we appreciate your candidacy in sharing!i had taken a shit ton of drugs once... and experience this. Holy shit. worse feeling ever. everyone was out to get meHow did you fix thisAre we talking your internal voice in your head, or strangers voices?

Edit: we all talk to outselves sometimes, was this the case or voices youve never heard befoteLike you heard actual voices talking to you or just your inner monologue?I’m sorry but your comment hit home a little. I don’t hear voices but I’m always imagining people hate me or I did something wrong. I think it’s more social anxiety than anything. And I realized I had it is when I bring up things I’ve been obsessing about for ages and no one else involved remembers. I feel crazy. Are the voices ever startling like if someone startled you because you didnt know they were there?Have you ever watched the TV show perception?  How does it stack up?Is it bad to think I wouldn’t mind having nice voices telling me optimistic things throughout my day? Question: are you seeking treatment/medication? My biological mother has schizophrenia and refuses treatments, and I was looking to get some other perspectives Did they start quietly that you remember? And slowly get louder over the years? I have played a good amount of live music in my day and have a mild case of tinnitus, ringing in my ear. Sometimes, that ringing starts to sound like inaudible whispers, not in my head, audibly outside, and if it’s quiet enough it’s louder and more clear. The whispers grow louder and more stern. I realize I’m possibly self diagnosing, but I’ve been worried ever since I worked a state hospital. It can be stress induced... there was a time when the whirring of my dryer evolved into a voice asking if I understood it. When I didn’t, it got mean. I also know you’re likely not a doctor, just asking about your experience Are you taking medication? Do the voices tell you to do anything?You said the voice is unique. Is it a voice of someone you remember? Does the voice have an accent? Does it sound like a celebrity or cartoon character? How old were you when you were diagnosed. Also, have you dabbled in any psychedelics. Was there anything strange as a kid? Or was it just one day you woke up and started hearing voices? My father was schizophrenic and it really tore him apart. I'm really happy for you that you can make it work. What meds are you on ?How negativity has Schizophrenia impacted your life? Do you feel that it has prevented you from doing things you would have otherwise been able to do? What is the nicest thing any of the voices has ever said? If you can't pick one, what are say two or three nice things they said?So when people say "voices" do they mean literal voices like someone is talking to you out loud? In what ways is it different than that feeling telling you to jump when you're in a high place.

Not trying to say anything about anything. I genuinely have no idea what that experience is like, so I would love to have it compared to an experience I do understand.

Like I'm not schizophrenic, but did have a very traumatic childhood in a plethora of ways and I've woken up screaming because all I hear is alarms blaring so loud I can't even hear my own screams, but that's more PTSD I think.I am glad things are better for you now. My mom has schizophrenia and it was the medication that helped her. How about you? How did you get better? Do you take medications? How long have you had it? Thank you. What was your firsr reaction hearing the voices?
Weren't you like "okay they're coming out if nowhere they're fake" or did actually thought their real?If you changed country with another language would the voices eventually change language too?Speaking of a movie/story with schizophrenia as the plot check out [Legion](https://brandonsanderson.com/books/legion/legion/) by Brandon Sanderson. It's definitely **NOT** schizophrenia as a main plot device, but it's something similar that drives the plot along. It's actually a fun take on the seemingly lame idea of a schizophrenic leading character.You said you get some nice voices too, what do they say? Also from what you said about a schizophrenia movie, i recently watched A Beautiful Mind, based on real life events. Dont know if youve ever seen it before or if its incredibly accurate but it was definitely a good watch, would recommend. There’s actually a really interesting show on Netflix named “River” where the main character is schizophrenic. And not like the classic “crazy” kind of way. He recognizes the voices are not real and just like you said, there are good ones and bad. I recommend you check it out if that’s what you’re looking for. It’s one of my favorites!Do you still manage the pop n sweets?"Maybe a youtube video" -voicesThis sounds so scaryIt makes me so happy that your wife was supportive and that you told her before things got too messy! As hard as I’m sure it was to endure, Im really glad you’re doing better and things have settled ☺️this is the only one in the thread that stopped my heart.  i'm so glad you got the help you needed, brother.  may you have many decades ahead of you. be well.I realize that this is sort of a rude/dumb question, but do you and/or your wife still worry that you might hurt your family?  I would imagine it being (or having been) quite a struggle for you both.  How did you deal with it?  Thanks for sharing.Wow that is a incredibly late onset. Did you have any mental health issues before the age of 30 that could possibly lead to this?See this scares me because I'm 31. I didnt know it could happen so late in life. I'm sorry this happened to you, it sounds terrifying. You are very lucky to have a wife who supported you ❤️It must be so scary because they actually seem so real right? Like no matter how hard you rationalise it, what you saw was what you saw? It's weird hearing about parents doing the right thing on askreddit.Wow. You sound like you were wise beyond your years at nine.Hello thank you for posting this comment. I'm just curious about when you mentioned the fact you knew the voices weren't real. I'm 19 and I've had "voices" for a long time like it will tell me to do stupid things like hit my hand against the wall really hard and that if I don't I'm weak. Most of what it tells me is to harm myself or that I shouldn't trust anyone since I'm "too perfect". I should probably get this checked out but I genuinely didn't know that the voices told people to hurt themselves. btw I haven't been diagnosed schizophrenic but I know it runs in the family.How do you deal with it when something is happening? I mean you know it isn't real, so do you just ignore it? I've always been curious as to how people handle this. If someone isn't on meds, could visual and auditory hallucinations work together and appear completely real? If you see someone and they get into your face and annoy you, what happens if you try to shove them? Does your perception of reality shift and they actually fall and break the coffee table? Can they appear to move things and later you realize they never did? I have so many questions.Strange question...

These people that don't exist. How real are they? Because as a person who's never had this before I can only picture a hologram-type thing where it *looks* like it's there but it's intangible. 

So can I ask you to elaborate on that? I'm very curious about hallucinations and stuff like that. If you were to try to touch one, would you feel it? Are the voices connected to the fake people(like do they have to open their mouths for you to hear them speak)? Could you describe what the experience is like seeing things. My hallucinations are often auditory rather than visual, unless I'm blacked out then I hallucinate entire environments, tv shows and everything until I snap back to reality from whatever I was actually doing. Are you visual hallucinations very clear sharp images like a literal person you could reach out and touch or is it like you're imaging someone is there that's so vivid it seems they are there? I can't really explain it well...This is creepy as hell :(I often hear singing. Rock N Roll. Like. Electric guitars when I am in the shower or bath. I thought someone in the house was just playing music real loud. But when I went to turn off the water so I could yell for them to turn it down there was nothing...

Turns out it is just because we at the time had just put glass walls and door in the bathroom to replace shower curtains. And all the sound would bounce off all the walls. I had heard things in the shower all my life periodically. But it was only recently because of the glass housed shower/bath I realized it was just my brain trying to fill in the blanks to what it perceived to be incoming voices that were just echoes. Sort of a reverse story to the theme here. I am sane after all! Guess I am lucky to hear electric guitars than mean voices...

Best I could compare it to would be [W.A.S.P](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsoLb-E7oy8) But like. Super faded out. And real distant. [Another example](https://youtu.be/ktQfK3Jo-zk)

If you turn it down to the point where you can hear his voice. But not quite actually understand what he is saying. Then you kind of get a good idea what I am on about.Did you erase your story for some reason?Has this post been edited? All the comments talk about his/her story but all I see is a link and a short explanation of the link...Amazing that you caught it at the age you did and that your mom listened. Medicating children is overall a bad idea, imo, but yours is a perfect case of where everyone got it right - you, family, doctors. That is almost never the case. Best wishes for another excellent 15 years+. > I would not necessarily say use this to diagnose yourself without first talking to a doctor, but this is a visual test that people who have schizophrenia always notice that fools most non-schizophrenic people. I said most, not all, so don’t freak out.

I stared at that pic for a good 10 minutes.  No matter how I looked at it, at what angle, squinted eyes, etc...I cannot see how it could possibly be actually caved in.  I mean, that twirling dancer silhouette I can change direction of on a dime so she goes back and forth between left and right, but this...damn that video confirms that I can't force myself to see the illusion.Sounds terrifying. Sorry you had to go through that as a kid. Lucky you your parents took mental health seriously. I dealt with debilitating intrusive thoughts as a teenager that made me terrified I was going to kill myself (a feature of Harm OCD), and my mom took me to a religious counselor because she was suspicious of mental healthcare practitioners. I appreciate her concern for me, but I would have been better off seeing someone who knows how to deal with OCD.>The one thing that they usually tell us when we’re seeing things is to just talk to it and say “I know you’re not real, go away.”

Have you ever told someone real that by mistake?holy crap this is intense, I never knew schizophrenia was like thatI seriously can’t for the life of me make that picture out to be caved in!! It’s irritating me. Wow that manifested early for you. So sorry you have to go through this shit but it sounds like your parents set you up for success Dude I "kinda" feel your pain. Not that I go through it but I understand. I once did an assload of meth on accident and heard voices and saw people for like 4 days I thought I was gonna lose my mind. The thing I'll always remember most is how I KNEW it was a result of the drugs, yet because I could hear it, I couldn't quite convince myself it wasn't real. 

And since someone's gonna ask: I didn't do meth on accident. I did entirely too much cuz I didn't realize how strong small doses were and just how long they lasted (answers: really strong, and for-fucking-ever)So interesting. I'm a fairly new therapist, and I found your story so compelling. It's remarkable, I think, that you cite this as the first hallucination you had, but somehow you knew immediately it wasn't real.

I almost wonder if there was some other small contextual clues that something was wrong leading up to this. If I heard a voice in the shower, I'd be really startled and peek outside. But you had the foresight to know it wasn't "real." Remarkable >  I knew it wasn't real but it wasn't really scary so I just kinda ignored it.

Holy crap, seems that would very un-ignorable.  I can understand if it sounded like they were in the other room, but in the bathroom?That video is crazy. I can't make myself see it. No matter how hard I try.The hollow mask thing is related to "[face blindness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosopagnosia)". It's also been shown to be related to autism. I have Asperger's and the first time I saw it I didn't see the convex face until I read the description of the illusion.

This is pretty common for me in optical illusions, like the "orientation" of [a cube's outline](http://www.se16.info/js/circumcube7.gif) ^^/(is ^^the ^^frontward ^^face ^^the ^^lower-left ^^or ^^upper-left ^^square?) , which apparently isn't that uncommon, but I don't know to what extent this has been studied in both typical and atypical people.I am very confused about the optical illusion. Is it saying that as it turns, we see the inside of the mask and it looks like a regular face?

The video I saw was a mask constantly turning, am I ever looking at the “right side” or is the whole thing always inside out? That's really good you were able to be diagnosed so young in order to manage it, but I also can't imagine what you might have been going through having to take some of those meds from such a young age. Some of those antipsychotics have some reallyy bad side effects, especially if they were the "traditional" ones. [It's incredibly rare that you experienced symptoms at 9 years old](http://www.schizophrenia.com/szfacts.htm). I'd normally say you're lucky that you caught it early, but this is not one of those things that you want to catch early.What do the people look like when they're not there?

I'm so intrigued that the human mind can trick itself like that. 

So when hallucinations occur, did you usually recognize they aren't real?In consideration to the voices you were hearing, did it feel like the voice was coming externally, or internally within your head?
I'm so glad you found a treatment that works! Good response by your mom.Really proud of you for telling your parent and your parent for listening.So is that actually how that works? People will actually see other people who aren't there?Question: when you would hear the "voices," were they inner only, or would you hear actual auditory sounds? I hope I'm not being insensitive, but I want to understand. When people talk about hearing voices as a symptom of schizophrenia, does that mean you literally hear it as if it were a person talking into your ear?That is terrifying Schizophrenia sounds scary as hell holy shit. Man fuck *all* that. I get the jeepers from scary movies at night sometimes, but that shit is just another level.So, it was like a clear audible voice? I have intrusive thoughts of similar content frequently.What did the voices sound like? I’ve always wondered.The voices that you hear/heard was it a voice that you’ve never heard before or the voice of someone familiar like a family member? How do you know these hallucinations are not real? I’m not schizophrenic but have occasional hallucinations  (probably bipolar, sometimes lack of sleep). When I’m sleep deprived and hallucinating,  eye know the hallucinations aren’t real. However, when eye hear my friends speak, eye generally have to ask them if they were talking. Eye have an idea that it’s all in my head, but sometimes eye speak, and that’s why eye like to ask. You see people that aren’t there? Is it scary or does it feel normal?God that's terrifying. :(Have you ever done psychedelics?I don't want to paint with a broad brush, but in general do people with schizophrenia lead a "normal" functioning life? I ask because you say you don't have many issues with it with a few exceptions. Forgive my ignorance. Is there a reason the voices tend to be negatives? Like why don't they say things like "work really hard and be nice"? 
Did you the voices or visions you experience ever hold grudges? You've seen people that weren't actually there?!! That'd creep me the hell out. I feel like schizophrenia is just someones lack of ability to process intrusive thoughts... Or something. I walk through my office at work and my internal voice thinks "what if I started smashing everyones monitors... Yeah .... Yeah.... Just started screaming at the top of my lungs.... Huh.....not today though, probably shouldn't do that" then I get the chills that i would even think of that, and move on. 

I've learned that these are "intrusive thoughts" and it's your brains way of processing what not to do.

But whenever I hear stories of schizophrenia it sounds like this, but one level up.

Could be wrong...So I’m actually kind of curious. What exactly does it sound like when a schizophrenic voice talks to you? Is it more like whispers or is it just a full fledged voice that sounds like someone is behind you. I’ve always been curious I'm curious, as a person in internship to be a counselor, is there anything you can tell me that might help me when working with folks who have the same diagnosis? Like what should I know or do or say (or not) that you wish counselors knew? It sounds like you had a good and trusting relationship with your parents in childhood. How is that relationship doing now?With all sincerity, this may have been the most interesting thing I’ve read on reddit. Thank you for taking the time to post. What was the meds that worked?Fascinating thanks good luck to you . Do you not find it scary ?I work in community mental health and I want to know as someone who is working with individuals having either a full psychotic break or seeing/hearing things, what can I best do to support you in that moment? Particularly, think back when you were younger because many of my clients are also cognitively impaired and not all of them are at an adult level of intellect.

My typical go to currently is to acknowledge that the person is hearing or seeing what they're experiencing and then also tell them I don't hear/see it. I make it clear that I believe them when they say the room is on fire to them or that their Chucky doll is in fact running around. Those are two actual examples. I tell them I believe that's what they're doing, hearing, feeling, etc. I then tell them I don't see it, feel it, or whatever the hallucination/delusion is.

Everyone is different and familiarity with clients let's me better tailor what I do for them. That being said, the more nuance and input I get, the more things I have to try to find a best fit. Specially from someone so able to communicate clearly and vividly.I wonder why the beings and hallucinations you experience are always negative? Youve never had voices that gave you positive reinforcement? Im curious. I understand if you don't have time to get to this, but do you have sleep paralysis and the sometimes associated hallucinations too?My brother is bipolar schizoaffective. It is extremely difficult to handle as it comes and goes throughout his life and he is normal one day and in a different plane of reality another day.That was most definitely a convex face talking to me. That means I'm okay, right?When you see a person or animal that isn't there, if your parent was in the same room and walked over to the space this figure exists, what does it appear like to you? 

Does the physical person simply pass through the imagined animal or person like in movies or tv when a live person walks through a ghost?

I'm terribly fascinated.> As the weeks went on it started saying full sentences, telling me to do stupid shit like jump down the stairs or prick myself with my dad's insulin pen.

You sure it's not a demon?I know I'm late, but hug your family for me! You got a great one at that:D Have a great day:)Damn, I’m really struggling to see how that’s a concave mask. I guess that’s a good thing though lolMy fucking parents told me to stop trying to get attention when I tried telling them someone was talking to me when no one was around. This was also early 90s, and mental health wasn’t really what it is today. Have you ever tried to interact with objects you know for sure aren't real?It sounds like you have a really supportive family, and are close. I'm curious if something traumatic happened early on for you and your family? You absolutely don't have to go into detail if you don't want. There's a running theory that schizophrenia (schizoaffective disorder) is closely linked to PTSD (from which I suffer), anxiety, etc. I was told that Maslow's hierarchy's foundations not being met could very well lead to this. A constant feeling of fear can, etc. 

That said, I find it very interesting that schizophrenics in North America experience there hallucinations as malevolent more often, while other places they're friendly and helpful. 

Adding a test for you- apparently schizophrenics can apparently tickle themselves. Fascinating.Jeeeeeeeze. I get that paranoid feeling someone is there in a room when I know it's empty, but I just figure it's a certain level of paranoia, I over think things and such.

I cannot imagine having that feeling and looking over and seeing someone there, and having to convince myself they're not real. That's terrifying.Am severe bipolar 1. The biggest time I had auditory hallucinations it sounded like I was in a stadium full of thousands of myself and they were all shouting at me. I just laid down and cried for hours.Your brain being able to render the shadows is freaking amazing.  That's awesome your meds have worked out for you. Unfortunately, I've seen the other side so often (community mental health) that I don't often see see that, so yay! 

FYI: From someone who does diagnosing, and as the sister of someone who has schizoaffective disorder, it is not that rare, and it doesn't, necessarily, affect the severity of the delusions and/or hallucinations, although it can. Schizoaffective disorder is essentially schizophrenia with bipolar episodes overlapping the symptoms of schizophrenia with periods of schizophrenia symptoms separate. 

Also, and this doesn't seem to be the case in your situation, lack of insight,  aka anosognosia, i.e. not even being aware of the symptoms, is hella common with schizophrenia, which makes it difficult for so many to even be aware that what they're experiencing isn't typical. One of, if not the biggest, obstacle to treatment. 
> Not all hallucinations are voices or people. Sometimes it looks like the floor is moving in waves like water or something. 

when you hear auditory hallucinations like you did in the shower, are they worse when there is background noise like that? if there is noise like that I hear voices in them. I can't make them out, but I hear them. it's hard to describe. it's like when I'm out in a noisy bar. the volume of the person I'm talking to is fine, but I can't pick their words out of the noise soup. 

Re: the hollow mask illusion, the first time I was presented with this (in an abnormal psych class), I got the schizophrenic result, which REALLY worried me, as bipolar and a few less-common disorders run in my family. However, the example we were shown was a 3D modelled digital video, [similar to this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sKa0eaKsdA0). After much freaking out, I quickly discovered that I get normal results when an actual physical mask is used. I'm not sure how common that is, but I definitely feel that digitally produced versions of the test are irresponsible. Thanks for your link; I got the result I was hoping for.Whenever I take mdma after the event has finished and I'm sitting at home or walking back from the event I will see people/animals like you just said, I also get the wavy walls and floors. Is mdma ushering in some sort of schizophrenia? Have you ever considered that the things you see or hear are demons or a demon? I mean, spending tons of money on drugs is great and all, but I would at least give a priest a shot. Just for the heck of it.This comment has made me terrified of Schizophrenia despite never really experiencing any of the symptoms other than occasionally hearing voices say single words like "hi" or my own name split seconds before drifting to sleep which doesn't really count since my mind is in dream mode anyway. Just the pure thought that generally normal people who don't suspect it can have this happen to them at literally any moment is mortifying to me, you're much more level headed than I am for being able to deal with this. I'm considering checking with a doctor just to get this damn fear out of my head.Somehow your description of your hallucinations made me think of my dream characters. 

Every dream character that realizes you're not sleeping stops whatever they are doing to stare angrily at you, a type of "you weren't meant to see that -fbi" type of thing. Monstrous strength on those buggers too.This is got damned terrifying what the fuck brainsI've had some instances where if I'm laying down on my side, I can hear either music in perfect detail or legit noises that sound like either traffic, a train down the road, or my roommates bustling about in the house, but its only through the one ear, not the ear thats against the pillow. I can lay there for minutes and minutes and minutes and either listen to the music or noises. Songs play in full tracks. But the second I sit up everything disappears and it goes silent. I've sat up a handful of times in the last year to get it to stop so I could fall asleep, it never comes back the same night after I sit up. I've also had experiences in very low light where the popcorn ceiling in my room will dance around and move in waves like water how you mentioned in your story. I personally find it intriguing, and always have. I've never felt threatened or scared over it. Your post is fascinating and has opened my eyes a bit.Have the voices ever tried to contact you through a comment on Reddit..? Thank you for the great insight on your condition ! :)My husband is diagnosed with Schizoaffective Disorder. He is also a drug addict most likely as a result of this. It's tearing apart our family. I don't know what to do or who to turn to because it's such a rare and uncommon disease.Thank you so much for sharing your experience. 

Very interesting about the hollow mask. In my psychological test class we also learned that when shown rorshach inkblot tests, people diagnosed with schizophrenia tend to see shapes composed of the white space, rather than just the inkblot, as neurotypical people do. Random, but something I found interesting. Thank you for sharing your experiences.Provided a rare insight! Thank you.Thanks for sharing. Sending my best wishes to you and your family. It's incredible how detailed our minds can get. I'm not schizophrenic, but I recently became lucid in a dream. I could see every chip in the stone wall in front of me, every flaw and color. I could clearly hear my friends who never existed ask me what was going on. I told them that I was dreaming. I felt a cold breeze, looked around the edge of the wall and saw the valley stretched out before me, beneath the mountain on which I stood. I saw the streets, the farms, the houses in neighborhoods that crept up mountains on the far side. I saw the sun shining through clouds that shed fog into the valley.

It was unbelievable.My older brother is bipolar schizoeffective and it has essentially ruined his life and made what little he has lived absolute misery. I feel so sad for him because whenever he seems to be doing better he gets off his pills and starts losing his grip on reality. He's in jail right now (for violating the terms of his suspended sentence) hopefully he'll get the treatment he needs and stays there until his pos wife takes off again (she's usually the one who convinces him that he doesn't need the drugs and users his vulnerable state to manipulate him and feed into his paranoia). Have you tried interacting with these hallucinations out of sheer curiousity? Is it possible to have conversations with them or try to understand them?It is awesome how supportive your parents have been for you!Even I love your parents after reading this.Now this makes me wonder if the people you see are based on real people, or if they're sorta like videogames, randomly selecting from number of features you've probably have seen irl.This may seem weird...but have you ever thought of learning a different language? From studies, people suffering from schizophrenia that speak English seem to have depressing or violent hallucinations; but not all hallucinations are the same based on the language. For example, those whose primary language is Hindu have very consoling and comforting hallucinations (almost loving). Just... something about our innate language is violentI'm a little late on this, but what happens to the hallucinations when you realize they aren't real?  Do they just vanish or?That fucking face scared the shit out of me.[deleted]That’s an incredible story, I hope you’ve made positive progress (in any amount) on rebuilding yourselfThis story really intrigues me.  Do you mind if I ask some questions?What kind of music do you hear? Is it comparable to a real genre? Is it all similar? Do you like the music? Does it repeat or does your mind make up new music at all times? Could you theoretically write it down/sing it or is it just too different to real music and/or fleeting? What happens when you actually listen to music, does the made up music stop? If so, do you like listening to real music more or less than listening to your music? Sorry to be so nosy, but this part is just super interesting to me.can you elaborate on the music partI know someone like this too. Thought terrorists were plotting to blow up the local nuclear power plant (which is decommissioned), the FBI was spying on her through the TV, and gangs were coming to kill their dog. She drove off to who knows where a few times. Eventually she took the dog and was gone for a few days. She had let the dog go in the middle of the desert (weeks later we found the dog and its doing fine now), committed a hit and run, and was on an involuntary hold at a mental hospital. She eventually got out and moved around the state until her 3rd(?) involuntary hold got some meds into her and she straightened out really quick.

She's now back in the workforce for the first time in 25ish years and stable. She sounds like my aunt. She was on and off her meds for years and constantly disappeared for days and weeks and once she even disappeared for an entire year (she checked herself into a mental hospital but refused to tell them her name for a year. We thought she was dead until the police finally found her). Finally she just up and walked into the woods outside her house one winter without a coat and never came home. Her neighbor found her body a few days later. 

Schizophrenia can seriously fuck you up. :/How does your dad deal with it? My mom has this too and has apparently been having an affair with Bill Clinton for like 30 years! We found a box of unsent letters to him when we were cleaning out her last apartment. It was a very full and large box.       
Also I am royalty because Princess Diana-something and also my Dad is apparently an abuser and so are her parents so getting her to do things is fun. A mother motivated to protect children is scary when it's displaced to the point where she tries to take her kids or calls the cops on us every few months.       
Also she is TERRIBLE at doing her makeup and walks around with a loosely (if im lucky) tied robe on.That single exclamation point is messing with me. o_oNot to freak you out, but there are cases of schizophrenic children not believing their parents are their real parents, and killing them, believing they're doing the right thing. That gotta be really hard for dad(as well for the rest of the family of course)My Mother has dementia. That sounds alot like her after my Father passed away. But to her, he faked his death and was running around with the nurses that were taking care of Mom.I work in mental health and this is the first comment that actually rings true to me. Classically, my schizophrenic clients reject the 'psychiatric explanatory model if mental illness' or believe that they've been diagnosed by mistake. All the comments above describe people who know that their symptoms aren't real, which is not typical of my clients. Typically my clients are also too disorganised or distracted to write as fluently as the comments that appear above this one.

I'm not saying that the higher ranked comments aren't real, but they're certainly not representative in my experience.> My mom has this and constantly talks to the FBI and Obama

My mother "has a friend in the CIA" as well as one in the FBI supposedly. And she's always distrusting of doctors and medications and usually pretty angry and comes to the weirdest conclusions. She also talks about seeing ghosts and the paranormal. We know she doesn't actually have friends in government agencies, so it makes me wonder.I have a relative like this.

The house is full of demons. Her parents aren't her parents. They're demons too. Everyone else is cool tho. 

She's adopted a nocturnal lifestyle so sometimes I wake to long chains of text messages structured like one side of a telephone conversation. It's like she's having a conversation, only I haven't said a word cos I was asleep. Clarifications, follow-ups, details. It's all very coherent, if not logically connected.

She's fixated on a certain period in the past, but she's aware it's the past. Keeps giving me details about specific events from those years. > She also talks to her doctor who tells her not to take her meds

Does he say this IRL or is this just a *hallucination* of her dr.? A guy I know speaks to Obama too. He spoke to him through the TV telling him there'd be £10,000 waiting in his bank account if he smashed his room up and checked his account. Also, he is always accusing his family of pissing on his toothbrush and his mattress and stuff. He's also convinced that Eminem needs to die because he steals all this guy's bars and Eminem has effectively prevented him from starting his own rap career. Obama and the FBI are spying on him through his bedroom walls and feeding the lyrics to Eminem who makes a fortune from themParanoid schizophrenia is awful.

In psychotic episodes my mom believes the government and the people in the radio are trying to hunt her to make her commit suicide. She also thinks the government places random people around public places to mock her about my dad's suicide which 'they' staged.

The fucked up thing is that it isn't something we have talked about or she has explained to me. This knowledge comes from my childhood, in which I have seen this numerous times leading to conflict. She acknowledges nothing at all to be wrong with her. There's no non creepy way to say i want to listen to that. If you are comfortable with it, and what not, amy chance we can see the video??Damn she must be high up on the food chain if she has Obama’s direct line, good for herThe start of this sounds like anxiety.What age did this all occur? What are the time frames? How old are you now? Glad to hear you're doing well now!My brother is also. I was wondering what I can do to help him without over encroaching on his space. We haven’t had much of a relationship post his diagnosis but I want to support him. Any advice?"Shadow people" is a term that has come up a few times in the thread. Would you mind sharing what you mean when you say that, and describe them a bit? I've been having experiences incredibly similar to this since I left high school (I'm 19, it's only been just over a year). I've been wanting to get checked it for a while now but I don't know where to start or how I'm going to afford it. How did you get on the right path?I've experienced your second paragraph in these recent months and now I'm a honestly a little worried...BUGS ON SKIN. When I was a kid I OFTEN felt like there were things crawling on my skin. I actually felt them on my skin but when I'd look there was nothing. Now the rational side of me wants to think it's just the clothes and the body hair interacting but it also happens on just bare skin. This continued for a few years and I eventually just grew out of it.
Younger me didn't know what schizophrenia was, so for the longest time I thought I had bugs INSIDE my skin that were crawling. THAT MADE ME VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AND PISS SCARED, but I never told anyone because I was MORE afraid (straight up phobia) of finding out the possibility of my theory being right.

Disclaimer: I don't actually know what happened when I was young, whether it was schizo or not, I'll never find out. I'm just glad it stopped.Oh my lord there's a name for having symptoms of both but not actually explicitly being either one? I've felt that I am exactly that for a number of years now but thought it was ridiculous. I identify strongly with things you (and others) have said here. For a long time I had what I would call "grand conspiracy paranoia" (truman show complex). Thing is, my symptoms would always come and go in phases, like how a manic depressive may have phases. Last couple years I've been locked up in my room hiding from the world (reall not going out), so the paranoia has died down and I can't say if I still walk funny; it may come back if i were to go out. All I get now are touch sensations that I can't tell if they're real or not (muscle spasms/tingling/rare vibrations).

My default mood for a decade for so has been 'flat' - literally the only way to describe it; my doctors says I'm just depressed (i mean, i am tbf) and I would have to push for a diagnosis but I'm worried it's all in my head; I'm a hypochondriac with physical illness and I don't want to push for a diagnosis of something I'm not.

Frankly, I could probably do with a few years of psychological assessment but free shrinks are such a pain in the ass to deal with and I'm kinda scared of the answer. Schizoaffective? Guess I'll look into it (like that'll help lol)My mother has this..  I barely recognize her anymore.  She's a like a ghost that haunts my father's house and travels with him sometimes.It's fascinating to me that u/meteoritesalad mentioned schizoaffective disorder and how rare it is, and then a couple comments down a schizoaffective person appears I have anxiety and depression and recently some psychosis. My symptoms between just regular anxiety and the psychosis went the exact same way. Forgetting how I arrived or why I arrived somewhere. Easily confused etc. Turns out this was the beginning of the psychotic episode I am currently still in. Anxiety and psychosis is literally the most uncomfortable I've ever felt. I'm so glad you're doing better now.Whoa, this reminds me of when I was a kid I would occasionally get this feeling of "am I in a dream? What's happening?" I remember once it happened while I was at the supermarket with my friend and her mom, and I had to grab her arm to make sure it was real and told her, "I feel like I'm dreaming right now."> Something wasn't quite right when my memory started to decline. Then my cognition got worse, if that makes sense. I'd start walking somewhere, and halfway there, I'd forget how I'd arrived at my location, or why I was even there. I thought I had stumbled out of a dream.
> Then I started giving too much weight to ridiculous thoughts and ideas. Normally humans can dismiss stupid ideas like their thoughts are conspiring with the universe to give people cancer, or that everyone is conspiring against you, but...sometimes it went a little too far.

I deal with this A LOT. Should I go see someone?> ...Bugs on my skin

Woah, you just reminded me of an experience I had when I was a lot younger, probably around 10-12. I was in bed trying to sleep when I saw all of these bugs crawling towards me on my bed. They all looked like black beetles, about 3/4" long, probably 15-20 of them all spread out around me in a perfectly spaced circle marching in towards me at a scary fast pace. They were only a few feet away, but every time I'd close my eyes and open them again, their position would be "reset" as if it was Deja Vu. 

It didn't take long for me to freak out and run upstairs to my mother who was still up watching TV. I don't recall what I told her or what her response was, but she wasn't of any help. I could not go back into my room so I lied on the floor at the top of my basement stairs (my room was in the basement) and guess what happened? The bugs we're back, doing the exact same thing as before. Again they were all perfectly spaced out in a circle, crawling forward towards me. Still resetting like Deja Vu each time I'd close my eyes and open them again. After what seemed like an hour of irrational thoughts about what was going on and feelings of just keeping my eyes closed and maybe they would go away, I fell asleep. I haven't seen the bugs since. 

Looking back at it all, I used to also have terrors when I was a small kid (3-5) and have seen "ghost" in my house. I can't remember much of it anymore, but from what I do remember and from what I have heard from my mother on the terrors, I would just run though the house, screaming and distraught as if someone was coming to kill me. Nothing I screamed would make sense and I wasn't processing anything from the people around me, this would go on for sometimes 10-15 minutes before I'd cry and exhaust myself to sleep.

It makes me think how much worse it could have been, that it could have been an every day thing with with nearly anything possibly being out to get me. It makes me think back to a lot of dark things I've seen, heard, or done. Man, it could have been so much worse. This is a very accurate description.  I've got a few questions -
Did you have small gaps in your memory (remembering names) or did you lose years at a time?
Did your memory get worse with medication?
When you woke up at a location, was it always somewhere you have been before?  If you drove, did you have difficulties finding your vehicle?

I'm going to bring this up with my therapist  when I see them again I have diagnosed bipolar, and a lot of these symptoms as well. I see shadow people, so I thought my house was haunted. I had one grab me and I mentally broke down about it. I also have such a bad memory, I often can't recall what I did the day before, I have to write things down, I get so angry about not being able to remember things. I would take medication twice and make myself so sick, I've had to go out of my way to organize my life. The only things I hear are random voices that sound like they're coming from a TV, usually when I'm very tired. I also guard my thoughts because I think people are listening, when I KNOW they aren't, I just do it anyway. It's always made me feel ridiculous. 

This is crazy, I'm going to speak to my psychiatrist about this. Thank you, this post may have solved these weird things I've been brushing off for too long. How far is too far? When eye describe my delusions, people say they make sense (except for one of them - the one where we are controlled by these unknown forces and everyone is trying to convert me but it’s actually true if you think about it; it’s just a bit debilitating to avoid people). Can schizoaffective symptoms be heightened by weed? Eye only have these dissociative episodes when eye smoke weed or go through extreme stress or trauma. My ex boyfriend made me really paranoid and told me not to talk to a professional about my hallucinations and dissociations. This sounds very similar to the psychotic episode my brother had. Trying to save the world, he thought me and a few others were in this special 'task force'. He also thought he was communicating with us telepathically, bunch of other stuff. Lots of paranoia too.You experienced psychosis, it’s terrifying and a lot of different things can cause it. Generally it’s not ongoing though as schizophrenia is. Psychosis is a lot more intense but shorter term.

I suspect the medication caused it, by any chance was the medication Clonazepam?200+ comments or not, thank you for sharing.My mom has schizophrenia and the same exact thing happened to her vision after taking some sort of medication. Even after stopping the mediation a few years ago her vision is still messed up. I don’t think you should ever label your “delusions” or thoughts as embarrassing. “You” were not having them, so you have no reason to be embarrassed. With these types of disorders, the mind can literally force these thoughts upon you, causing you to react to them. I mean hey, if i had been told by my mind that i was going to be part of a team that was going to save the world, I’d believe it too. I’m really glad that you’ve gotten the help you needed and are living a happy life since that. But again, don’t ever be embarrassed by something that took hold of your body without your control. > There's already 200+ comments at this point but screw it. 

This is actually fun to read from somebody who entered this thread at 4200+ comments.

edit:  After reading the entire comment, I'm kind of embarrassed about this post I mede.  I didn't mean for it to be insensitive, sorry.  Thank you for sharing your story, and I'm happy to see you recognized it from the start and got help.  I'm glad to hear you are doing well.[deleted]This thread is getting old, but i have a hypothesis about your eye brightness sensation.

I have a friend who's schizoaffective.  When he was having an episode, his eyes would look dilated.  dilated pupils are a side effect of hallucinogenic drugs, but I'm fairly certain he wasn't taking drugs.

Perhaps your eyes were highly dilated, bringing excess light into your pupils?  

btw all the best to you and I hope things are good in life![deleted]Is wanting to fix the world a symptom of schizophrenia? To me it doesn't sound like it is.> Sometimes my tongue would feel huge in my mouth, or I would feel like my feet were miles apart even though I could clearly see they were right next to each other.

I used to get that in my 20's when my anxiety was really, really bad. I haven't felt it for awhile though. Do you know what exactly causes it?growing up, i related to almost every one of your examples. kinda has me wondering what’s going on upstairs. It's kind of ....    for lack of a better word....  interesting that it affected your proprioception. The sense if where your body is in relation to itself. Interesting. I experienced almost all of the things you mention here when I was an early teenager. Like eerily similar, I broke down in tears seemingly from nowhere a few times, in school in front of all my friends, another time in the street playing football with my brothers.

People were baffled why I was crying, I didn't/couldn't explain it. But it was because it was just so hard knowing how different I was. Everything seemed to come easy to everyone else, and by that I mean just being, for me it always felt like an effort. 

I also had this cartoonish mode/fantasy I would drift into. I even gave the episode a name, I would look at someone I know, and either experience them as if I had never seen them before, they would feel and look like a total stranger, or on other occasions, a 2D cartoon.

By about age 14 I had given a name for this experience, and I had created names for the alternative selfs my two best friends at the time would shift into.

I never told anyone about it. I never got treated, but it just kind of went away. 

I'm still a bit different than everyone else, I think everyone would say that about me, but it's never held me back, I have plenty of friends and have had good relationships with women. A successful career etc.

Interestingly/coincidentally/spookily, about 10 years after my episodes stopped happening, one of my best friends was having a kid with his girlfriend, and the name he chose for his baby was the name I had given to my episodic alter-ego of him. I had never told him this name, and it's a very rare name that nobody I'd met had ever had.

Anyway, I always just put it all down to introversion and a vivid imagination to be honest. I think you might get a lot out of this one neurology book I read. It's not about schizophrenia. Just the way the brain maps to our bodies. It's by v.s. Ramachandran, called phantoms in the brain. It's about phantom limbs. Utterly fascinating. The descriptions of the sizes of your tongue and feet reminded me of the neurological homunculus in that book.Holy Sh! I have that same feeling sometimes, mainly when I am in bed getting to sleep. It feels as if I am on the other side of the room, or a feeling of shrinking and expanding. Its a sort of depth perception that feels off.That doesn't sound like schizotypal PD to me. Isn't it schizophrenia? Personality disorders aren't diagnosed before 18 years of age.[removed]May I make a book recommendation? There's an amazing book called "The Center Cannot Hold." It's memoir written by a woman who is high-functioning with schizophrenia and actually went on to become a professor of psychiatry at UC San Diego. It's very inspiring. You still have hope, even though you might deal with this illness your entire life, you can still make a worthwhile and fulfilling life for yourself. I struggle with mental health as well, and I am still struggling to find where my place in the world might be, but I have hope now."But enough with the bragging."

You've got a good sense of humour at least!Aw I'm sorry. I understand the frustration of knowing this is a life long illness. I hope you can find some comfort through it all.Some of my family has this disorder. When Im tired, I see things which is common enough. Then late one night driving home, I swerved to avoid a dog in the road that wasnt there. I didnt hit anything but it terrified me. i sat in driveway freaking out with car in park. I heard whispers and noise like people speaking a foreign language. I was straight up having mild heart palpitations at this point and crying, and thinking about how fucked i was. And i was so scared of the voices. 

Then i turned off the car and they stopped then came back when battery mode was activated. The voices were on a ‘blank ‘ section of a CD i had burned from a pirated audiobook. Whoever originally pirated storm of swords had played the audiobooks aloud and recoded them with a mike to upload that recording then left mike going at the end of a chapter. My mind was distracted by near accident so I didnt notice chapter ended and track was still playing as each track was about 1 or so hours long but the blank section was kids fucking around in a foreign language Fellow Schizoaffective here. First voices I heard was when I was a bit younger. Thought I was hearing a radio in my room. There was no radio.Hey man, you're articulate and, like wwawawa said, funny. It certainly seems like you have true ambitions and feelings; don't just give up hope on a life you want. You have obstacles that many do not have, but I bet that also gives you insights that many do not have. If I was a selfish self centered person, I'd love for someone to politely mention something to me about it. [removed][removed][removed]There seem to be a lot of musically and artistically talented people with schizophrenia. From what I understand, the illness makes everything a bit more abstract, so it makes sense. I've seen some really whack outsider art from people with schizophrenia that's kinda cool, even though I really have no context with which to understand it. Are any of the songs you've woken up to available for listening?Would like to listen to your music, as a songwriter myself. :) You can DM me if you're okay with that.I also dream original songs. Sadly they're usually not very good. So do you then go ahead and make the song real? I mean record it using your voice and instruments etc?Can I listen to some of your music?[deleted]I dream whole songs occasionally, used to do it more in the past where I'd dream whole symphonies. Now it's mostly guitar riffs!I too would love to hear your dream songs!Huh I dreamed songs when I was in my teens. But I had no musical training so I can never translate or recreate them in real life. I'm  in my 30s now though and it doesn't happen anymore. I'm reading through this thread and a lot of the symptoms speak to me. It guess if I have something, it's mild enough that I'm still functioning. https://youtu.be/igKZhwDOLac

I got to the end of your post, and wanted to say thank you for sharing your experience. I'm glad to hear you're doing better! Could you clarify what "dyschonesia" is? Google doesn't bring up much, just suggests it might be "dyskinesia," which I'm not sure is what you meant...Errr lcsw?What is dychonesia? I tried Googling, but literally, the only thing popping up is other Reddit threads. Thank you for sharing that, you have a way with wordsBrilliant writer!   Glad you have come so far. > starting as a schizoid is like having one foot out the door, and going through it can be an easier choice.

What did he/she mean by this?[removed]It seems like the existence of a restraining order should prove to a doctor that this girl is real. One doesn't typically have imaginary people get restraining orders against them. Do you have documentation of that?I was taking private Russian lessons from a lady who had schizophrenia, and I once got a call from a doctor when she got hospitalised: he asked me whether she could really speak Russian, because he was having trouble figuring out what was reality and what was illusion: her hallucinations involved a KGB agent who would send faxes into her head.Time will help. You probably feel this is outside of your control and its not fair. Treating the situation as something in your past instrad of in your present or future will help, even though the act of letting go will cause you pain. It’s pain you can take. You definitely should tell your therapist everythingMy mom at her worst does the staring-into-the-void thing. It's hard to unobtrusively shake her from it and even then it's like talking to someone in shock or on anesthetic. Words seem hard for her to string together into a coherent thought and she loses track of everything constantly. Thankfully, that is never a forever-thing. She is also schizoaffective btw. Holy shit, no wonder they thought it was possession back in the day. Thank god for modern medicine.This sounds like a high school friend of mine. 

He talks to himself and spaces out. All of our mutual high school friends have pretty much ostracized the dude. 

He refuses to take medicine. He says he feels depressed and suicidal while on meds. I advised him to try different meds that may help

It hit him hard around the age of 22-23ish not sure. I think it’s worth mentioning that he had a SERIOUSLY fucked up fee incidents growing up. Not sure if it’s relevant but yeah One of my best friends is schizoaffective, and his house is right on a highway where we live. Last year he put out a cig on his wrist (it looked gnarly as fuck) and then tried to walk into the highway. His girlfriend grabbed him and took him inside thankfully.. he said he didn’t remember any of it. Shits wild.How was your sex life ? Were you hypersexual ?How are you doing lately? Better, I hope. You deserve happiness. I hope you’re well now and it’s a shame that you had to be hospitalised before anybody actually took your problems seriously. I work in mental health and I see it happen all the time. 
I had the same problem, because I ‘appear’ happy I mustn’t be depressed and struggle every day and because I ‘appear’ healthy then I mustn’t have an eating disorder. I’m finally getting help at 32 yrs of age. 
Hey, could you explain how stomach problems are related to all of that?Wow. That sounds absolutely hellish. I’m so sorry you have to deal with this.Being a 29 y/o woman, reading this scares me. I've had a bit of the minor stuff like sounds/voices/music and paranoia, but it's all pretty rare so I always just write it off as being tired, but there's always a part of me that goes "But what if that's not it...?"Holy crap. You make me so glad my antidepressants and antipsychotics are working. Your description is so vibrant and vivid. I had a good friend through high school and college that has very recently (age 40) developed severe delusions and paranoia. I don't know if it is schizo or not, but he's a heavy drinker so it may be alcohol induced psychosis. Either way... He's convinced that a bunch of us are out to get him. "Us" being friends he had in high school int he 1990's. He said we have all conspired to make him *think* he is crazy and he knows he's not. Accused us of spying on him through his cable box and hacking his bank account... He basically lost all his friends because he's literally gone insane and won't let anyone help him. He was always sort of low functioning and comes with a family history of severe mental health issues. I wish there was a way to force him into getting treatment, but he's 100% convinced we've all done all these horrible things to him that none of us have done. It's sad.Holy crap, how did you manage to keep a job?> a naked, wet-looking guy who tried to stab my eyes out with scissors. 

Serious question, could this have been a hallucination based off the greased up deaf guy from Family Guy?This sounds really similar to what happened to Justin Lowe, guitarist of After The Burial. RIP.Thanks for sharing. I'm in my internship to be a counselor, working on an inpatient, short term psychiatric unit and we see our fair share of patients with schizophrenia. Any advice you can give me for working with folks in similar situations to yours? Your experience is almost exactly like mine. Except I was 27 on the onset of the psychotic episode that lead to my diagnosisWow thanks for sharing. Has there been any research on alternative medicines? Or breakthroughs on surgeries that could be done? Oh wow. Your detailed description really matches my aunt who acted this way after my grandmother passed away. unfortunately for her, this was back in the 70's and she was admitted into a psychotic asylum. They electrocuted her brain thinking that she's possessed and crazy. I feel so bad for her now...Jesus christ, that sounds terrifying!>occasionally hear noises (screams, explosions, etc.) in half-awake states.

This sounds like auditory hypnagogic hallucinations, they're similar to sleep paralysis, not related to schizophrenia. I get this sometimes, I'll hear a door closing or a voice when I'm partially asleep.Same here with the family history, that's actually why I asked the question. Have been noticing things lately that seem like they could be attributed to schizophrenia, but I might be psyching myself out. The loud noises while half-awake are [Exploding Head Syndrome ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploding_head_syndrome). I get them too and hate them because of how jarring they are, but if you’re like me, you might feel better after knowing more about it. > I sometimes dream as an entirely different person

Not sure what you mean here, like, you dream you get to be president yourself or you dream from Trump's point of view?

I definitely change point of view within a dream. If I'm shot, I might be making my getaway as the murderer the next second.  Or maybe I'm just "the director" of a scene, not really in it but just deciding who says what and how things play out before becoming a character myself.

I always took that to be more rooted in lucid dreaming though, and a hell of a lot of video gaming.  Gamers lucid dream very easily and I assumed things like dreaming in third person or dreaming as a director just came from that.I can relate.

I get so paranoid about it sometimes because it's super prevalent on my mom's side and I'm about the age where signs may show. I used to trip on acid, so maybe I have false experiences that I just mentally buy into, but some of my behaviors and experiences freak me out. They are very far and in between, but I can't help but question myself sometimes.I remember reading something about how vivid dreams/nightmares can be associated with mental illnesses, but the science isn't solid because it's such a hard thing to study/monitor in an objective way. I used to be super interested in parasomnias because I have had issues with sleep-talking, sleep-eating, and vivid dreams. I also have dealt with ADHD all my life, as well as anxiety and depression as an adult.I'm not totally normal (Asperger's), but I'm definitely not schizophrenic. I have the same thing with long dreams, extremely vivid as well. Can be very tiring. Don't worry too much about it. I don't think it's extremely common, but I don't think it indicates anything is wrong either.> I sometimes dream as an entirely different person

Is this weird? I do this all the time. Sometimes I'm multiple people in a single dream session, sometimes multiple people/viewpoints of the same scene. I don't dream as a different person, but my dreams are "cinematic," which means they're shown from a variety of angles. So I can see myself in my dream, but I'm still the "main character," or it's largely being shown from my perspective. And they're so freaking vivid... they feel almost more real than life itself. I can remember huge, detailed portions of the plot and imagery if I think about it as soon as I wake up, and I dream from the moment I fall asleep to the moment I wake up. I don't know what's normal in dreams, but there is a history of schizophrenia in my family, too. But most of my dreams are great... so I'm not complaining.I wake up to weird shit like that all the time.

I woke up to see myself strapped to a table, and my sibling and his friend holding a gigantic white tool that they were about to stab me with.

Then I opened my eyes to see my sibling and his friend standing in my doorway holding a gigantic nerf gun. They laughed and left after mumbling something.

I wasn’t strapped down when I woke up for real, I was actually sitting with my back against the wall, and my hand on my knee and my other leg laid flat.

I asked them about it later and as it turns out... neither of them own a gigantic nerf gun.

So I hallucinated an odd dream in a half awake state, and then an entire nerf gun. This is about as real as it’s gotten for me, I’ve seen spiders on the walls, the walls literally warp and stretch for me, and it feels like my acne is crawling across my face sometimes. The only time I’ve hear a voice was when I got super paranoid and thought someone broke into the house, and then I heard a female voice say something along the lines of “we’ll get him later” before I realized there weren’t any females in the house and I was home alone.

My least favorite weird wake up scenario went like this:

I woke up, to an immediate feeling of pure dread. I assumed someone was hovering over me, and then a mans voice whispered:

“Shhhh... we will kill him when he wakes”

And then I fucking jolted upwards.

I’m not diagnosed with anything but I’ve been looking into getting help. I’m a minor and my parents are a bit useless when it comes to these things.

Haven’t been to school on years, haven’t been to the doctor in years, last time I went to the dentist was most likely January.

Speaking of the dentist I often hallucinate the smell of laughing gas. Makes me nauseous as fuck. Along with the smell of smoke, and occasionally random foods.

Just felt here was a nice place to share my experiences. I do this!!! I dream as other people a lot, and sometimes even dreams with myself are from a third person perspective- like a movie camera. Lots of times I wake up tired because I feel like I've gone through a whole day just sleeping.

 
A few times I've even had visual things where I'm half awake and look around the room and see something spooky like cracks in the walls or even bugs. It scares the shit out of me.


I have no history of schizophrenia in my family, but my mom has bipolar disorder. Now I'm worried, too!

But it's only ever happened while sleeping.Have lived a fairly normal life so far.  Recently, I will hear voices (only a few times in the last year or two) when I am just about to wake up.  Very different than the end of a dream.  More like someone is really talking to me out loud.  Different voices each time, not familiar. 
 Wasn't sure what that was all about.  I think the voices as you're falling asleep are normal. I'm supposedly psychologically healthy and I hear voices while I'm falling asleep. Often they're the voices of people I know, speaking unintelligibly but with the right accent and sound. It's not threatening or anything, so I don't mind.Thankfully sane but I've always been weird with sleep and dreams. Most people say they have dreams but can't remember them, I'm not aware of dreaming at all. 99% of the time, it is just lost time to me. The 1% is a half-dozen seemingly proper dreams (all very violent and fucked up) over the course of my entire life, and these half-awake mundane waking-dream things, where I get up and have a shower/eat something, before realising I'm still in bed, staring at the ceiling, and haven't done a god damned thing.

Odder still is I'm an insomniac and damned near narcoleptic at times but I always know when I'm about to fall asleep, as my thoughts become nonsense - but I'm aware that what I'm thinking is gibberish. I've had people tell me that I've talked gibberish when they've woken me up, too, but I have no recollection of that, or of much else that happens just after waking up most mornings.As a few others have said, your description reads like unusual REM activity including hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations. In particular these bits: "I dream almost constantly when sleeping" and "I feel like I never get an "escape" from life" are almost word-for-word some of the things I would say to describe my own experience of sleeping and are very typical of people suffering from [narcolepsy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcolepsy) (which I do). 

If you also experience some of the other classic symptoms such as excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), sleep paralysis, memory problems, and muscle weakness when experiencing a strong emotion (such as laughter, joy, fear), then you might want to see your GP.

If you are not experiencing these other symptoms then it could be something else, maybe even as simple as needing to sort out your [sleep hygiene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_hygiene) if it isn't very good.

My partner gave me some very sage advice recently: if you are worried, then you should see a doctor. They are there to listen and reassure as much as they are to treat and prescribe.Same with the dreaming. I thought it was normal!Number 1, I'm no doctor but I've heard weed suppress dreams. So that might be an option. 
If anyone has some more info on this fill free to chime in. Hearing noises when half-awake can be normal. Look up "hypnagogic state."That's called hypnagogic auditory hallucination. It's extremely rare, both my sister and I have it. 

Edit: from the comments it appears it isn't rare. Last time I read about it that's what the stats says. Ever changing science! Sorry for the fake news. I have a family history of schizophrenia, I often have very confused before bed / after waking up thoughts. I once woke up in the morning where my dreams had me thinking I was a hunk of metal about to be taking to the blacksmith. I was awake and thought I was an inanimate object. But yeah hear things at night and hallucinate a little throughout the days. My parental grandma had it, grandkids only have like a 2% chance of getting it, while the general population has a 1% chance.

I have heard voices while drifting off to sleep tho, only once that I can remember off the top of my head, it was like a movie narrator for a dream I was about to have.I have a family history as well (father, uncle and grandmother) . I don't have any symptoms of the illness currently. But, I also always feel slightly paranoid that it will develop later in life since women tend to be late onset. I'm pretty sure that's all normal.If it makes you feel any better, I also hear explosions/other types of loud noises when I'm inbetween waking and sleeping states, especially on transitioning from wake to sleep and that period of time between wake and sleep is (I think) longer for me than for other people, who report 'blacking out' rather than being aware of the process of them falling asleep so I have all kinds of other hallucinations during this period too - usually aural. When I was a kid I primarily heard voices speaking to me when I went to sleep, or sometimes I would see 'characters' in my room, but as an adult I primarily hear music playing from 'somewhere outside of me in the room'. And I am also frequently simultaneously aware that I am on my bed going to sleep and starting to dream at the same time - like having split awareness with the dream happening and 'real life' happening at the same time.

I have no history of schizophrenia in my family and from what I've read these kinds of hypnogogic hallucinations are common. Been like this since I was a kid.Has anyone had the issue where they'll suddenly wake up from sleep or be trying to sleep, and be locked completely in place or it be extremely hard to move, and the whole room feels like it's violently shaking? I actually forgot about it until it started happening again recently. I tried googling it but only got rocking bed experiences. This is full blown, titanic earthquake feeling I would imagine. And while it's happening my whole head is full of rumbling noises and sometimes talking. Sometimes I'm aware it's going to happen. I'll lay down to go to sleep, and upon closing my eyes I can feel and hear the rumbling in my brain and start feeling the shaking, so I'll open my eyes and get up so it doesn't happen. Other times something random will happen in my dream or I'll hear a gunshot like noise and I'll instantly awake into that stake. Like one night I was dreaming I was on the beach, and suddenly a massive Godzilla sized shark jumped out the water followed by the gunshot sound and I woke up right into the weird earthquake episode. Another time my dream abruptly cut off and I was shown an image of some deformed baby out in a car seat in the woods at night crying. So it's always really weird shit like that right before it happens. Have you tried to attempt lucid dreaming? Just a thought but might help you whenever you can accomplish it. Not the best thing for someone who might have schizophrenia, but if you are past the time where the disease presents itself cannabis can prevent dreams in most people.Marijuana is known to make dreams harder to remember (if at all).[removed]Glad you're doing better. Was that your only symptom? Why did you want to kill him?Woah, hope you're fine now!Reading this has made me realized how every day hundreds of opportunities open up for murder, yet most take none of them.If it makes you feel any better, he probably could have shoved you off if you  tried, unless you are very strong for a woman and he is very weak for a man. 

What were you feeling and thinking in that moment? Were you thinking you wanted to kill him, but aware you shouldn't? Have you had any thoughts like that again? Was this after a fight or anything?Did you ever the tell him what happened exactly that night? What was his reaction?[removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed]Would you possibly post some pics of the notebook? That sounds really fascinating! But I understand if you’re not comfortable with it. Also I hold you’re doing better now.So what happened next?Wow like the movie A Beautiful Mind[removed][removed][removed]For the safety of your children, I️ hope that you never resist your treatments! I’m glad you are feeling better with medication. I've been questioning talking to someone about this. I've lived in haunted houses before, everyone experienced the same things I did. The only issue, is that every single house I've lived in has been haunted. If it wasn't, it would suddenly end up haunted. Started happening out of the blue here one day and no one else experiences it. I see figures and animals from the corner of my eye, including my cat, who died in February which completely destroys me. Sometimes I won't directly look at him so he doesn't disappear. Showers get farther apart because I feel like the light will switch off and something in there will get me. My nightly ritual consists of making sure the bathroom light is on and the two bedrooms by the door are closed, with the hope that whatever entity is in there will stay there, and whatever is in the bathroom will leave me alone if the light is on. Tried bringing this up with a psychiatrist when I started entertaining the idea that I wasn't actually cursed and being forever haunted. He brushed it off and I haven't mentioned it since. I'm not really sure how to even talk about it.Has it helped? I hope everything is moving in a more positive direction now.

Take care of yourself.You were able to pick up on that when you were 8 and ask for appropriate help? That's remarkable. I'd like to hear some examples of exactly what with your emotions wasn't rational that promoted you to realize that.This one is interesting to me, I don't hear voices or see hallucinations, but I always feel distant and that life doesn't really exist and I don't really fit in with anything. I sometimes feel like my life is a little like the Truman show and I notice patterns that fit into this story. Does this sound anything similar to what you experience?I'm so glad you shared your experiences of your symptoms. I never knew schizophrenic folks could even describe these experiences in such intimate detail. It genuinely changes how I will engage with strangers. 

Just curious, is there anything we can do when interacting with schizophrenic folks to help them feel more welcome? Like certain body postures, tones of voice or considerations to make?
This one stuck with me, the screams, what were they like?Thank you for your story.That could have been really tragic if you hadn’t been there. I️ am so glad you are seeking treatment for him. It takes time to get the right medications for an individual. I️ wish you luck![removed][removed]How are you doing these days? 

Some of these posts and yours especially do have me a little on edge to be honest as I'm experiencing some of the same things you have gone through. A panic attack several weeks ago (which has made me look back at my life and realize that I have more than likely always had an anxiety issue which were never diagnosed and is just now starting to get worse) and recently a friend told me that I was being paranoid about some things. Never any problems with fuzzy thoughts but simple things and short term memory have been an issue for the last several years. I can take some medication (blood pressure for example) being very mindful that I am taking it (literally telling myself that I am taking this medication and to remember that I took it) and then 15 minutes later start walking around going "Well did I really take that medicine or did I imagine it? Am I sure I took it?" it feels that I sometimes am in an "autopilot" mode for small tasks and then I'm never really certain if I did the task or not. This "autopilot" mode has led me to doubt if I locked my front door or turned a certain appliance off after I have left the house. This makes me turn right back around and go check. I've sometimes had to check my front door twice after leaving (making it down the street and then turning around both times) just to make sure that I really did lock it and really did check it.  Was your problem with simple things similar to this or was it more of an inability to remember simple tasks or knowledge? [removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed]I'm so happy for you! All the best dear!! regarding your friends acting differently: they probably -do- act differently, a little bit -- because they're somewhat different people now that they've moved through life,

and if they had been accused by you in the past or aware of your condition, they might try to be more careful around you (but not necessarily because they feel anything against you. they just want to be sensitive to the situation)

and your mind is probably also exaggerating things as well :bI wish you all the best in life & your education! :)Wow. What you describe sounds like a seriously raw form of experience, primordial in a sense. Undoubtedly terrifying. I'm intrigued by your attachment to the God character. Were there other voices that you missed? Others that were positive? 

I feel like our modern form of consciousness tries to smooth and bridge and integrate all the different components in the brain into a unified structure. But also I thinj it can easily fail at this process, either due to a condition like schizophrenia or drug-induced. 

It almost sounds like what you experienced was the unmodulated, unintegrated inner workings of your brain, something most cannot witness. I wonder if there's a way to help people understand these mechanisms in their brain and reach a unified whole (if they so wish). Or perhaps to even accomodate the un-unified components.That was one hell of a read. Thanks for sharing!
Wow...this was amusing but equally frightening to know how different the world must seem to schizophrenic pople, with severe symptoms like these how would you rest? Did you sleep normally?[removed]What was the turning point that brought on the actual diagnosis?not to be dismissive of how disruptive that must be, but wow that's hilarious.. just imagining you sitting there hearing "now you're WRI-ting a - NOTE- in your notebook, tralalala, getting UP to the BATH-room la - la - laaaa lalalala"

what do they actually sound like?? xDI would get second, third, fourth opinions. If your alarm bells are ringing, so to speak, I would definitely insist.

I'm currently under observation for possible bipolar, and we are exploring an aspergers diagnosis, but these experiences are bringing up some memories that I know I'll be bringing up with my therapist.

Say something. If they don't listen, I would ask for another doctor.It could be that instead of schizophrenia, you could be BiPolar 1. Bipolr 1 is different from 2 in that it includes psychosis (and a few others things)  that may manifest itself in the same way schizophrenia does. However, i think getting different opinions is a great thing if you have the resources to do so! Were the visitations scary? If so, then why wouldn’t that be noteworthy to discuss? I’m trying to understand how the delusions work. I feel you. I lost my wife to Schizo and what you described I can relate to. Sad. Thanks for taking the time to describe your experiences. Really happy to hear that you've gotten better.. (:I am so, so sorry this happened to you; that must have been terrifying. I am glad that you had the courage to share your story as well as the strength and intellect to apply logic before thinking/acting in a very illogical world. What do you mean by "drugged with cool"?Makes sense. We are pattern seeking creatures but it can get out of control. Im glad meds help. I have a friend who is epileptic who has some of the derealization. Brains, man. [deleted][removed]Thanks for mentioning that sub. I didn't know about it. My gram (who is one of my best friends) has schizophrenia. I would love to hear from other people who deal with this so I can be a better granddaughter and friend to her. The smiley face is weird after that comment.My brain emulates thoughts from other people almost constantly. And when I'm alone it simulates my friends. Like they'll pop in and give their point of view on a lot of things. It's almost like my brain is an accumulation of everyone's mind. I can look up and ask for a specific person's opinion, and I'll hear it (in my head). There are all different voices in my head, some male, others female.

However, these voices usually make themselves useful and provide different points of view on a situation. Some will even tell me things that I've never heard before, almost like they're teaching me. I don't dream very often, maybe two to five times a month. Not looking to get rid of them, though.This doesn't sound like schizophrenia so much as either epilepsy or an anxiety disorder.

[Constant deja vu is a symptom of both, and if you are experiencing this you should seek professional help for it](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-30927102).Please seek help ASAP you have it bad Makes sense to me. If it's any consolation, I read this and I hope you find/found a professional to talk to. I don't mean it in a negative way.Well, having experienced quite a few strange sensations like this myself, my non-professional interpretation is that you demonstrated an understanding that you did not in fact control the words coming out of that person's mouth. It's an odd feeling for sure though.

I see a psychiatrist and a therapist for ADHD-PI. I have all kinds of weird, non-productive behaviors like counting intricate/specific patterns of numbers, compulsively moving my tongue to different areas of my mouth, randomly having to quadruple check things. Sometimes I'll play out "the floor is lava" type scenarios in my head. These are just manifestations of my inattentive mind, kind of a space my brain occupies when I'm nervous, tired, distracted... Sometimes they seem to indicate I must clearly have a problem, nope. Just my brain doing it's thing. Happens often when my meds start to wear off. I get used to telling myself "hey, if it makes me feel better to put the tip of my tongue between a canine tooth and a bicuspid, that's what I'll do".

Perhaps you could run it by a psychiatrist or therapist if you feel troubled by some of these observations, no worries my friend. These types of doctors are around to help you, it's their job to help you understand your behaviors. Thanks for sharing.I call that delusionary bias "pass posting", a gambling cheat for dice or roulette.  Immediately after the roll, a quick distraction and slight-of-hand moves the bet placement to the winning square, or changes the amount of the bet based on the win or loss.  Uncanny luck!  But it's not hard to guess the winner after the roll.You explained it well. I think to a smaller and less frequent degree lots of people get that feeling. For a moment you feel like you are thinking what someone is saying a little faster than they’re saying it.  Almost like you are predicting it. 
This happened with me when ever I listened to music when I was a kid but I thought I was just really really smart. A few things in this thread seem familiar to me though. I also used to have deja vue a lot when I was a kid. I guess what I'm trying to say is I get what you're saying [removed][removed]You don't even need schizophrenia to explain reports of ghosts. I've never had schizophrenia, but in the weeks after my grandparents died , I kept hearing thier voices at night (same as when they were alive- thier room was right next to mine and I could hear their muffled voices when they spoke). 

It's a super-common, widely known psychological phenomena (but I don't think they have an exact explanation yet), when people die, experienced by healthy, non-schizophrenic people. Usually auditory, but sometimes visual hallucinations too. 

I'm sure schizophrenia is the cause of *some* ghost reports too,but I doubt its the main one. Even when it's 'normal and healthy', the human brain is pretty gullible a susceptible to mis-identification and delusion.

http://www.businessinsider.com/hearing-voices-of-dead-loved-ones-is-normal-2017-7?IR=T[removed]Thank you for talking about your illness and experiences. My sister was diagnosed with DID but it came on much like that of Schizophrenia. She is comorbid though so she also has psychosis. None of us knew about her suffering until she was about 14 and things began to unravel for her. Much like you mentioned, she thought the sounds and paranoid thinking was normal. Looking back I can now see where things were changing for her but we all just chalked it up to teenager hormones, etc. Her diagnosis is not good unfortunately and she struggles to try and maintain any semblance of a quality life. It took a while for us to wrap our mind around what she was experiencing. One of the first things she had said to me is that she would hear things and that she always remembered hearing like whispering sounds and that she thought everyone heard them. It broke my heart. I never knew. I get so caught up sometimes on what her life would be like without this illness. I get very angry about it because she never even had a chance. She was 14 when it started to appear and now she is 24 and though she does work around her illness, everything is very difficult for her. It's just makes me so angry for her.

I couldn't tell whether it was real or not - there was nobody at the door, but I thought it might have been somebody out on the street being a dick, so I dismantled the whole mechanism and I stopped hearing it. 

In the morning my husband found the buzzer in pieces by the door and pointed out that if it really *had* been making a noise, it would have woken him up as he's a light sleeper. I should have realised this, given that I was so careful to be silent as I was taking it apart. > Usually when I'm laying down at night.

that much, is hypnogogia. hypnogogia causes audio and visual  hallucinations when you're on the brink of sleep.

i have hypnogogic audio hallucinations while falling asleep, it also often sounds like a bunch of people just talking, sometimes i can make out what they're saying, sometimes not.https://news.stanford.edu/2014/07/16/voices-culture-luhrmann-071614/Yeah, One time I was living on the streets, and voices talked me into burning myself with cigs/lighters while meditating, but they also talked me into volunteering at a local museum. So I did that. It was a lot of fun.  10/10 would do again. (the volunteering at a museum, not the sleeping on the streets, and burning myself stuff, btw.) I feel the same way. know that they're just hallucinations, it's just off puttingI've done a lot of hallucinagenic drugs, and nothing has made me hallucinate harder than being awake for 36 hours. I'm talking in another world hallucinating. Sleep deprivation has symptoms mimicking a psychotic break and can lead to one if prolonged for long enough (3+ days). It's also common for kids to hear strange things. If it were to happen as an adult when you're fully rested, then it would be more concerning.I have an anxiety disorder and every so often when I'm sick/have insomnia I have had weird things happen at the border of sleep and being awake.


Auditory or visual hallucinations can definitely happen due to illness, extreme stress and sleep deprivation.  If you don't have them regularly and they don't bother you you're probably fine.  I've heard some scientists  believe a larger chunk of the population than reported probably occasionally has auditory hallucinations but if they don't cause significant distress or loss of function they just have no reason to tell anyone.  

That's definitely insomnia hallucinations. I get those too, though thankfully my insomnia has gotten less severe as I've gotten older. My longest stretch was 7 days with no sleep. I saw men in bio hazard suits on the side of the road, in the halls of my high school between classes, and there was a man laying on my ceiling, who wouldn't let me sleep.  

As I've gotten older its shifted to less terrifying things, usually leaves that hover just outside my field of vision so i can't truly see them.  

Best of luck with that insomnia. It's horrible stuff,  and doesn't just go away with meds. Gotta practice that healthy sleep space.  I know something's I experience I think ill leave alsoTL;DR: Drugs drugs drugs drugs drugs drugs drugs drugs drugs...Really glad you are doing okey now[removed]Could you say why, precisely, Phoenix vets are disadvantaged?I lived thru this my wife had schizoPeople have different reactions. You can get canabis induced psychotic episodes and that does not mean you are at risk for schizophrenia just that that is how your body reacts to THC.

The good part is that know you know how it is, how it manifests and feels and if it ever happens to you without using then you can react faster by going to the doctor.Did you get an answer for this? I'm in the same boat as you.Stop smoking weed, goddamit. Have the messages always been as supporting or encouraging like that first one?Difficult to tell from what you just posted. You should talk to a professional if you have any serious concerns. It could be a self-esteem issue, or you may be onto something. I’m only a psych student, not a professional in any wayAuditory hallucinations are a common side-effect of THC intoxication, so, thankfully, this doesn’t indicate anything abnormal about your psyche. This behavior you described is normal, so long as it is caused by consuming cannabis. Even sober, people can hallucinate auditorially in minor ways, especially when tired. You have nothing to worry aboutAnd why aren't you taking meds, which solely were created to help people in your position? Your mom clearly doesn't understand.Is there any way to help her? Or does she basically have to seek help herself? Does she feel it’s all 100% real or does she suspect her mind is making it up, at least partially?I'm no expert, but that seems pretty alarming. It's definitely something I would seek help with. You seem to be dealing with it well, but you shouldn't have to deal with that if you don't have to. its cultural, In other cultures it shows up as family members saying encouraging things to you etc. Since what you are describing is positive, it's possible that it's just viewed as someones muse, though in reality schizophrenia and schizo-effective both alter your ability to perceive the world correctly, at it's gentlest it leads to constant misunderstandings, I have to make sure  when I talk to my wife I fully explain everything and why 2-3 times or it gets twisted in her head in unpredictable ways.Fuck, that sounds horrifying... Like something out of a creepypasta. I have no answer for you as far as where the line between the two conditions is... but I did want to encourage you to speak to someone about it. Even just sharing the bullying experiences you went through with a professional. Getting help really... helps! I think scent hallucinations do occur in some people with schizophrenia, but if you’re experiencing that I think you should go to a doctor. Phantom scents can often be a sign of neurological disorders. I’m not a doctor so I don’t know if that’s the case, but it’s best to make sure!From another comment
> There was also audio and visual hallucinations, the audio ones was either my dad yelling my name loudly and angrily (he’s very nice and never yells so it was strange) and weird things like a lawn mower in winter. **I also smelled this gross sickly sweet smell sometimes when there was no cause for it and saw things like people but when I looked closer they weren’t there.**

Especially the deleted ones.Thanks for saying this. It’s alarming to me that this hasn’t even been part of the discussion.Wow, what a post. I'm glad you are at a better place now in your mind. 

(:I think I can relate except I don’t hear music. You mention external and internal, do you feel like it’s coming from a deeper part of your brain? Sometimes I hear sounds or yelling and I can definitely tell it’s coming from my head, it’s like the voice of my thoughts and subconscious comes from the outter layer of my brain but these sounds come from the inside as if it originates from the core and I can’t stop it no matter what, it just goes away on it’s own.You should try writing music.Hi, it is really nice that you are looking out for your buddy :). Some tips would be to just be nice and understanding to your friend; do little things that let them know that they can trust you and feel safe around you. Lots of people with schizophrenia do not have someone like this so it gets worse overtime. Try your best not to make crude jokes, use foul language, introduce "scary" topics, etc (this could make them not trust you if you did; just be very polite). The best way is to just straight out start talking about the subject, remembering to never refer to anyone as crazy or nothing like that, because it is very real. Let your friend know that they can talk to you about anything and you will not doubt them because they probably really believe in what is going on in the moment. Just a guess, but maybe they are paranoid and do not want anyone to know? If they are, just try to go along with it, asking them how you can help them feel safe. Some things that would be good is talking in a safe environment with no distractions (electronics for example). Hope it all works out!Upvote this.What happened to him?From your post history, it’s not a mole hill. Tell your doctor.  Isn't that how rational people hash out thoughts and figure out their own opinion on something by asking themselves challenging questions and answering them based on what they know and don't know? I thought that's what intelligent, rational people do instead of just saying things like "James Cameron is a Godless man therefore L.A confidential deserved the Oscar".So long as you're not experiencing this persistently, I blame LARPers.

EDIT:  [I found the business you were talking about](https://www.google.com/maps/uv?hl=en&pb=!1s0x48761b506778942d%3A0x9a3eaa1e3aa3550a!2m22!2m2!1i80!2i80!3m1!2i20!16m16!1b1!2m2!1m1!1e1!2m2!1m1!1e3!2m2!1m1!1e5!2m2!1m1!1e4!2m2!1m1!1e6!3m1!7e115!4shttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.localdatasearch.com%2Flondon%2Fclerkenwell%2Fbookmakers%2Fwilliam_hill-10024308!5sSt%20John%20Street%20in%20Clerkenwell%20William%20Hill%20betting%20shop%20-%20Google%20Search&imagekey=!1e2!2sI5m3q7LpMN0IqSO3puyZVw&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiA6Oewp73XAhUMyWMKHVyHC50QoioIajAK), and they have hosted themed costume nights.  You might have just have seen a private party.This would be a great premise for a fiction book. Get it checked, I was on the brink of this before and it only went away the second I got help from someone. I hate saying this but sometimes your well being is more urgent than your financial situation. Also the simulation effect happened to one of my friends after he took LSD. It almost drove him mad and it was only when he told me and got help that he brought everything back to control. I’m no professional but this is a prime example of people refusing to get help and it becomes too late. Also I heard voices when I was 12 but they went away, I’m scared they may come back however it seems to me they only come back after a seriously traumatic event. But you also have to remember that while there’s a sense of urgency in what I’ve just said, don’t panic, you’re going to be fine :) jHello!  thank you for sharing, but multiple personality disorder is different than schizophrenia.  It's okay, its a common misconception.[removed][removed]I've got countless, male and female with different points of view. Not diagnosed with anything but ADHD. I fit the script for OCPD though.So you actually didn't have people messing with you? Sorry I got a little lost halfeay through.I can't touch them. Either they disappear or my hand goes through them. That is not to say that tactile hallucinations don't exist: they do. But they typically manifest in a feeling on my skin (bugs crawling, burning, hair pulling, sudden coldness) and not going out and grabbing something. In other words, I might feel like I've been stabbed by a sword apropos of nothing, but I can't hallucinate a sword and feel the weight of the hilt in my hand.Concernining false memories.  When you meet someone for the first time, talk and whatever, then separate. When you think about them later, do ever feel like you’ve met them before this time? Like, you know for sure it was the first time you met them, but some part of your brain is telling you that you met them in the past as well.

It has been happening a lol lately. The first half about switching points of view was far too real for me. Thanks for this comment.You are not legally allowed to be that stupid. This court hereby orders you to go the fuck back to common sense school.I do this too. Started last year when I was 20 and I imagine conversations with people when I'm in public (and alone). A lot of times the person I'm simulating a conversation with will look at me at the 'perfect' time in said conversation, which leads me to think it might have actually been telepathy or something. I know telepathy doesn't exist, but my brain seems to think it does.

I've never been socially outgoing, but this telepathy nonsense has lead me to be even less sociable since I simulate conversations without ever talking to them.The brain.I take celexa too! It's a distinct drug from ciralopram, however! It's a related drug, citalopram hydrobromideMy mom was the same way, she suffered from Multiple Sclerosis though. My mom didn't have schizophrenia but it was complications from MS affecting her cognitive abilities and her unfortunately mixing up or over using her 15 different prescription medications that caused her to have conversations with herself to the point of yelling and screaming at some man and woman she was convinced were trying to hurt her. I told her many times over those years that these were all in her head but she would never believe me. She said that I needed my hearing checked. The weird thing about it was she refused to tell her neurologist about it and would "dial it down" during appointments to the point where she didn't talk to herself. It's very frustrating and difficult to see your mother deteriorate into something society would label, crazy or insane. She made numerous attempts at convincing my father we needed to move out of the house because the house was possessed by these people that would break in the house and harass her. There were moments when I watched television with her and she would yell "OUCH!" as if someone was pinching her or hitting her. Unfortunately she lost her battle with MS 5 years ago. RIP. The sad thing is I almost found it a relief she passed away so she didn't have to suffer anymore. No, hallucinations and delusions are real as can be to the person having them. Not by ourselves. However, it is possible to develop ways of establishing whether things are real or not. For example, I hear someone talking in another room of my flat, or I hear the buzzer going, so I look at my cat to see if he reacts. I know that if the sounds are real he'll look towards them or go to investigate. If he doesn't, then it's probably not real. As a person who has had very, very real experiences with the paranormal, as well as my boyfriend and my family, I don't know.

I'm sure people are going to shit on me for saying this, especially in this thread, but I'm not ashamed to say it, and I'm fucking sick of 'being in the closet', as it were. I know what I know. The world is not what it seems. 

If you believe there are no ghosts, or aliens, or whatever thing that doesn't fit your idea of reality, then you are an arrogant fool.

That being said, not every little thing is paranormal in nature. Paranormal isn't just ghosts, by the way.

Mental illness and hallucinations are very real, and account for most experiences. That, or mass hysteria, cognitive issues, etc. The brain is an extremely powerful, mysterious thing, and can fabricate false realities, cause hallucinations, etc.

I don't doubt this. I believe it as much as I believe in what we'll call the otherwordly. Supernatural. Esoteric. Whatever the word you want, I don't care.

Your comment is too vague to make any conclusions in either directions. You could be insane, or it could be very well. This will get downvoted, and we're going to get some hateful comments, but I don't give a shit anymore. 

PM me, and we'll discuss it in detail. One thing to be clear, though, is I don't necessarily 'believe' you. Like I said, you could be crazy, or you could be not crazy. I'm just open :)

In any case, I'll help however I can.It’s more likely that she went through a phase of psychosis then schizophrenia. i would definitely look up psychosis because the symptoms can be almost identical! I don't know about schizophrenia, but I was raised in a pretty aggressive church that my mom blindly followed. Sometimes, her home life didn't match up with church life, and she'd have to play it off. I wouldn't be surprised if your mother was having trouble reconciling her personal beliefs with something she can't control, and has assigned personal properties to. It's scary to think she's enduring this because she's afraid to say the church business didn't work or that they were wrong. Again... Not a medical professional. Probably for a GP/psych to determine - maybe write a list of concerns as you've done here and go with your friend?Go see a therapist? I don't know, I think Reading about it might just be the Same as googling your symptoms and thinking you have some serious disease when it's really just a Common cold.What other symptoms have you experienced? There is a normal amount yes mostly caused by the brain trying to fill in the blanks You'll usually express 2-3 types of hallucination with schizo-effective, I believe schitzophrenia should be similar. Like auditory( hearing things/voices) and command ( like someone important you want to impress is telling you to do something)As an additional note she was 25 when the symptoms hitBecause ghost aren’t real. Duh
edit: I'm not suggesting the following is symptomatic  of suffering from schizophrenia. I was simply responding to the above person letting them know others have odd sensory experiences that are not from a deeper problem. 

I don't have schizophrenia yet I see music; more specifically I see colors. it's not super intensive in the hallucinogenic way but it is very obvious and preset. 

this is nothing new and is quite enjoyable. it enhances both the listening and writing/production avenues in amazing ways. I have bad hearing. Over a decade ago i was really into weed. Unemployed, wake and bake type of deal. I started hearing what sounded like voices. Whispers. But i couldn't focus on them or figure it out. I soon realized the weed was making me paranoid, and due to my bad hearing, my ears would pick up faint sounds, and my paranoid brain would try and fill in the blanks, pattern it might be able to interpet, thus the whispers. When i stopped smoling weed, no whispers. And by the way it was the type of whispers that would make me turn immediatelt towards the direction i thought it was coming from to try and catch who was whispering despite logically no one could possibly be there. The brain is convincing AF.i have this all the time, sometimes i wont leave the house bc i feel like someone is out to get me or someone will come to me if i stay at the house, i think about people in my own family plotting against me. it takes so much time trying to sleep at night bc i keep thinking i hear things like someone trying to get in the house or my room or someone downstairs. i write it off as paranoiaWhat kind of drug? Once drugs enter the picture it does confuse the issue, with even a gateway drug in some causing terrible symptoms.I don’t think you understood the post. It was about why YOU or someone you know are schizophrenic and what made you notice that about yourself or them, not a random person you’ve never seen before and likely never will again. Spooky story though. Glad that nothing happened to you or your bro[removed]You should definitely make sure someone else 
knows the situationWell ive noticed in myself, if I notice something wrong, I end up exacerbating the issue simply by putting so much focus on it. Your problems are real just sometimes you might accentuate them because youre sitting there going "what the fuck" Obviously if you feel like you have a real issue or your doctors are just shitty and cant do their job, get a new one doctor, some doctors just suck.The main thing to realize is that there are many high-functioning schizophrenics who are perfectly capable of increasing public awareness and enhancing treatment as long as they're taken seriously. I use this reddit account for schizophrenia activism, and I'm also involved in several mental illness and schizophrenia support and activism groups.

Depression awareness is led by those with depression. PTSD awareness is led by those with PTSD. Schizophrenia awareness needs to be led by people with schizophrenia. The biggest thing you can do is recognize that people who live with the disorder are the experts on it, and help amplify their voices instead of looking to supplant them.I tried looking around for scholarly articles and gave up and tried Google and I can't find anything about that sort of situation. Wishful thinking I guess. Usually voices tell the person to do something or ridicule them or insite paranoia, unfortunately.I feel like there's a weird line between it being normal and it implying a psychopathology of some sort. Usually just hearing your name get called or a weird whisper especially in crowded areas or when there's little going on auditorally is pretty commonplace.How often are you hearing it? And where are you hearing it? If it’s at your house/Apartment it could be haunted. If you believe that sorta thing.*self diagnosedIs this a serious comment? LolTrolls, trolls everywhere.Maybe *you* can't think two things at the same time.3/10 obvious troll.[removed][removed][removed]This worries me, because I have a close friend that sounds a bit like this.  No schizophrenic symptoms that I know of, but his mother suffers from it, and I remember he once said he was at risk of developing it.

Currently he's diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and he's clearly been very depressed, and somewhat isolated.  I hope nothing more develops...

Also,

> Reading how many people had this as an early symptom makes me feel a bit uneasy. :D

That doesn't exactly sound ":D"-worthy!Incredibly. I'm not crazy about being on meds, but it's miles better than the alternative. I'm lucky enough to have found a good doc who I can be open with. It's always a good idea to talk to your doctor about any new symptoms. If you aren't seeing one I'd recommend checking into the ones your insurance accepts.Hallucinations aren't always pathological! Hallucinating in low vision is actually pretty common. I won't look in the mirror when I haven't turned on the light because I'll definitely hallucinate some weird distortions on my face.Sorry. Haven't been on in a few days. 

My symptoms generally last for a couple days, although sometimes they extend out for about a week. They're kinda few and far between these days, but it's pretty intense when it happens. Not OP, but we treat A LOT of people with cloz and saphris, but I work with clients who require a high need of care and experience intense psychosis and delusions often coupled with substance abuse and some client with TBI.I'm diagnosed as schizoaffective, bipolar type, and have been on pretty much every med in common use, including Haldol and Thorazine. What's worked best for me have been meds that end in 'apine' such as asenapine (Saphris), clozapine (Clozaril), and olanzapine (Zyprexa). Clozaril is the best med by a long shot for me but the side effects and weekly blood tests make it really difficult for me to take it. Zyprexa is a drug that was created to be a better version of Clozaril and works basically just like it. For me, Zyprexa is a close second and is a much more preferable med.Terrible question to ask a layperson. Consult a psychiatrist, and only a psychiatrist on medication.I had a pretty normal childhood. I was a bit shy and liked staying inside. Although I did get diagnosed with ADHD, which I hear is a pretty common precursor to things like that. 

Also my parents treated me very well and I was honestly pretty spoiled. I have some family history of mental illness though. It never hurts. I think seeing little things in the corner of your eye is pretty common, but when it happens constantly that's when I started to worry. It was the persistence combined with the other symptoms for me. If you're worried about it, a professional opinion could be useful. Hey. Sorry for the late reply. I haven't been on Reddit in a few days. If you have concerns, go to a doctor. They'll take care of you. If you don't have insurance look for free clinics around you. There's lots of support out there, you might just have to look for it. To be honest, that's one of the reasons I never thought I needed treatment. It happened in horror movies. I never believed in ghosts much but if I was seeing it with my own two eyes and hearing it for myself, it had to be real, right?

I wish I would have talked to someone sooner. I used to see this all the time when I worked at a gas station. Id be around the corner snd see deathly gray arms reaching over the counter and dragging their nails before disappearingOr the contrary.

How.much of our paranoia /schizophrenia is actually inspired or envisioned because of what we see in movies. I sometimes wonder if we didn't have all that crap that we watched on TV or in movies in our minds, would the visions and sounds be less extreme or less obvious...?Does it ever stop being startling? Do you have someone who knows you really well that when you jump from the hallucinations, they're like "hands?" and you be like "fucking hands."? Mine are always pitch black. And they just kind of slowly grip at the fabric multiple times. If I stare really hard, it's almost like they disappear but if I look away, they come back. That must be absolutely horrifying. Have the hands ever occured when you / another have been in the range of their grasp? Can you see / feel them grab you, or another person's clothes? How frequently does it happen, is it a daily occurrence? 

Thank you for sharing.For me, the weirdest thing was knowing that it wasn't real as long as it wasn't happening. As soon as the hallucinations started, all logic was gone. Instant fight or flight, usually in my case, flight. Idk. It's hard to deal with but I won't deny that I wish I knew how and why it happens. It depends on the hallucination. They kind of fade while I look at them if that makes sense. Schizoaffective disorder has almost ended my life several times, so I would sincerely hope that you don't. But I will recommend you speak to a doctor as soon as possible. Because it doesn't get better, it just gets worse without medication. If you suspect that you're suffering from a mental disorder, you should definitely seek medical help. The sooner you get treatment, the better the prognosis. Did you finish reading the comment? She realized something was wrong when a friend came over and didn't react to it.No, I've had no response to antipsychotics and had allergic reactions to several of them. Severe antipsychotic side effects are a significant issue in psychiatry in terms of medication adherence and quality of life, especially because prescribing is often trial and error. 

I ran across a database recently that showed all the liver enzymes used to metabolize different drugs. Theoretically you could cross-reference the different drugs a patient reacted adversely to, to determine which liver enzyme caused poor drug metabolism. You could then prescribe an antipsychotic which didn't rely (as much) on that enzyme. I haven't considered it since I've been stable for a long time.

No, my studies aren't affected as I've been stable since I left home at 16. I'm 25 now, and the only symptom is episodic visual hallucinations. I was raised in an adverse environment, and the removal of those social circumstances was the most important factor in recovery. I would say the biggest impact would be deciding whether I need to report my diagnosis to AHPRA. Any medical condition which impacts a doctor's practice has to be reported. 

I've been reasonably transparent because 1) Some of my colleagues used to treat me! 2) I think a lot of high-functioning people with schizophrenia aren't forthcoming with their diagnosis because it's a very stigmatized label. The stigma could be reduced if the average neighbour next door was open about their diagnosis, but for them to be open about it, the stigma has to be reduced. Bit of a catch-22. 

im calling bullshit on this one.No; in Australia, you aren't required to disclose any medical conditions when you apply. I cannot think of an occasion where it has made medical school more difficult. But when I was unwell it severely impacted my high school grades; I failed a number of subjects and had to take a couple of years off. I was pretty upset when I started university the same time my former high school peers were finishing their degree. Then I found out some people had taken a year off to travel, start families, dropped out and stared new degrees, etc... It was nice to learn that everyone just moves at their own pace in life. 

Sorry, but your mother is silly. There are certainly situations where chronic mental illness causes people to be very unwell, and that will limit their career progress. But as a statement, that's not true. 

We had a student conference recently where a nephrologist at our local hospital spoke about his bipolar disorder, and his inpatient stays when it was poorly controlled. I was sitting in the front row, and students came up to him afterward and asked for advice on managing their anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues. You can be anything you set your mind to. It's not that clear-cut. Many mental illness can be treated, many are temporary, most can be managed to the point of having a normal life. 

You'd just have to watch yourself a bit more. If an irregular schedule made you worse, maybe rather not aim to become an orthopedic surgeon, but take a specialty that doesn't involve so many nightshifts and emergency calls. An active mental illness usually comes with reduced stress-resilience, setting a doable pace is vital.

I actually had an actively psychotic eye doc for while. Going there for the first time was bit weird. She'd often explain your diagnosis to someone who wasn't there, or suddenly left the room to do something completely else, come back and pick up on the exam as if nothing had happened. The nurses had to make sure you got the right paperwork and not some other patient's prescription with your data scribbled in the margins. The thing was, she was really good at her job. Somehow she navigated the chaos in her head so skillfully, she was a better doctor than many others I had met. In a different specialty her problems would have meant disability, but she'd found a niche that worked out and people who caught up on the slack. There are many successful people who have schizophrenia, especially doctors. Look up Frederick Frese.In America, its very distressing how mental disorders are treated when it comes to med school.

A friend of mine was in school to be a psychiatrist, and foolishly told the truth in the third or fourth year on a questionnaire, that she had in her early teens been suicidal. Her school locked her up in a mental ward for a few weeks against her will, and advancing with her degree would have requires a ton of work to cure an illness she no longer had.

Its certainly possible in America, but its a ridiculous hurdle. In other countries, it is much more reasonable.If you work in mental health, it won't take long for you to realize that pretty much everyone else who works in mental health is also mentally ill. Anyway, I've also met a few doctors who had schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. A lot of people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders function very well with treatment. im fairly certain the original comment is bullshitI'm a mental health worker (not a Dr) and from what I know, stereotypical movements in the mental illness definition are repetitive, uncomfortable, odd looking motor activities. They can be a response to internal stimuli, that observers do not understand the purpose for.Not long ago I heard about tiptoeing and autism in children. I found the idea risible at the moment. This sounds similar, maybe there is somethingI've noticed that people with schizophrenia often walk quite stiffly. Just anecdotal, though.Same I walked leaning foward alsiI tried to find a free full text of the study I mentioned, but could only find the abstract. Sorry. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2375440
These are a few related studies which are full text. 
https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/339456
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17516759people on antipsychotics sometimes get the Parkinson's walk, which is like what you described actuallY! not sure if its really heard of without the meds though?This. Had the exact same question.Fucking hell. This is unreal.

I had almost the exact symptoms you described about yourself. "I'll sell my soul"-THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I THOUGHT WHEN I WAS YOUNGER. Like, exactly that (except in my native language). I also walked weirdly (it was right foot for me, and my foot had to be exactly halfway across the crack). I also thought I had control over things, but for me it was accidentally wishing my family dead.


I also "grew out" of it, when I was thirteen-ish. Until I read your comment I thought I was just a freak.Now I know I'm not alone.

u/Haquistadore Your symptoms sound more like OCD.. Your case sounds *way* more like OCD. Pervasive, uncontrolled thoughts and the feeling like your individual thoughts and actions specifically can have real-life consequences for yourself and others are really common symptoms.I had almost identical thoughts and behaviors as a child. Your experience of feeling that your excitement would cause something to not happen hits really close to home! In addition, I would pay attention to whether or not I walked around my home in a “clockwise” fashion. If not, I’d spin around until things were “reset”. 
I was diagnosed with OCD in my early teens. Like you I sort of grew out of his behavior. I no longer have the same types of intrusive thoughts or the need to engage in rituals to prevent things from happening. However, I believe as I entered adulthood my OCD just morphed into a general anxiety disorder for whatever reason.
Edit just to say it’s really interesting that other people experienced these things and then grew out of it. Huh
I did much of the same. Some of it still pervades, like the whole if I want something too much it won't happen. So I'll intentionally tell myself in my head that I actually don't care. 

I used to walk on the outer side of my feet, rather than the sole, and was entirely convinced that I was going to be abducted by aliens or something until I was about 11. 

Not a shining example of mental health, and I have been diagnosed with anxiety/bipolar/depression. I'm still not out of the loop yet, as I'm still young enough to start showing symptoms of schizophrenia at some point. 

Which I REALLY hope I do not actually have.Oh wow. I'm just blown away because I have those exact same symptoms with intrusive thoughts about accidentally selling my soul to the devil. It's... really hard to talk about, and I know exactly how insane it sounds. 

It's OCD for sure, though. It's not all hand washing and compulsive behaviors and rituals. 

Bizarre to think I'm not the only one out there with that particular thought set on constant replay in my head. Sadly, I never grew out of it, but... it's just something I manage. No one, not even my husband, knows. This sounds like OCD. Compulsive thoughts like that vs hearing voices or having delusions. I am so very thankful to read of your experience, as I had been given ADHD and the legal meth(ritalin) to go with it for very similar reasons, though I simply Had to be the last one to go to sleep in my house so that other mental murmurs would be small enough to let my overly active mind let them go.  
I was given the label of paranoid schiz but I think the doc was just a tired state employee that had no real interest in my state of being, and in reality I am an extremely mentally/emotionally/energetically sensitive individual who is not well supported in most non-tribal societies.
I also think that the OCD label is about as useful as a parrot complaining that a human is OCD when speaking or reading since the human simply Must be obsessed with those little symbols too much...Same here. When I was child, I had invasive repetitive thoughts, repetitive OCD-like habits, like doing everything in threes, obsessing over triangles, green things, and the number 7. My obsession with doing everything in threes meant I walked and/or moved oddly, because if there were more than 3 steps, I had to figure out how to navigate them in threes, either skipping over some of them, or putting both feet on one stair so it counted as 2 steps, etc. Just weird stuff.

I remember wondering if there was something wrong with me, and whether I would struggle with this my whole life. Next thing I knew, it was all just gone and I couldn’t relate to any of it at all. As an adult, I have nothing that would resemble OCD or anything close.Holy shit. I had the exact same fixation as a kid. I went on to have pretty bad OCD as an adult that eventually tapered off in my early 20s. I always, even as a kid, knew that the fear was irrational, which I think is part of what distinguishes OCD from true delusions, but the thought was so intrusive and scary that I indulged the behavior to get rid of it anyways. What you went through definitely sounds very quintessentially OCD. Seeing that fucking Wishmaster movie on late night cable where the genie thing takes people's souls definitely didn't help.woah. I feel like I was your early adolescent/possibly adult mental profile doppleganger. I thought I had had a variety of infectious diseases that I knew were impossible to have (like, ebola); was pretty sure that anything I wished would come true, but in a twisted way (like, a literal--but shitty!--interpretation) so I got in the habit of beig VERY precise with the way I mentally phrased wishes; I did the exact walking pattern you described. I also had sleep issues (Id stay up all night reading, and then intrusive thoughts made it scary to try and sleep, so Id read more) and those lasted until young adulthood.

I'm fine now! Ive got anxiety and have had a couple bouts with depression, but both are managed pretty painlessly. I also teach, and routine saves me from my shit organization at work. My husband saves me from my shit organization at home.

Anyway, hello, similar brain!I too dealt with similar intrusive thoughts as a kid.
The one about you scared about selling your soul is incredibly easy to relate to, and I had a lot of intrusive thoughts around dying and "inappropriate" sexual thoughts and also biblical thoughts. It then moved onto a fear of germs, chemicals, bacteria, anything dirty. Fortunately I too grew out of that but then unfortunately I took on a much more generalised sort of anxiety which created a massive impact on my mental health from age 17 to now (I'm 23). It's comforting knowing some one else out there has gone through the same things. 
> he'd travelled to visit his grandmother in Africa the previous year

Weirdly travelling from Africa is a big risk factor in developing schizophrenia which leads some to thinking it can be triggered by a virus which then leads to the immune system attacking the brain.Alright, reading through this now makes me question myself a lot more. I've had a lot of those symptoms as well, though I never thought it was schizophrenia. In fact, I was diagnosed with severe depression just a few months back and when my illness started to be acknowledged by my environment I started to experience some strange stuff.

Things like walking uniquely, like you described, were always normal for me ever since I was a  kid as well as when you said "If I wanted something too much, or was too excited for something, it would specifically not happen" - this is exactly what I experience a lot. Also, I think my emotions align with the weather sometimes, as it seems to always rain when I'm sad and crying and sun shining when I'm content.

Now, I have'nt heard any voices but it rarely happens that I thought I heard something outside and nobody else heard that. These are usually screams or meowing I'm hearing from the second floor or the garden. I never put too much thought into that until visual hallucinations like, seeing a second version of my boyfriend while simultaneosly seeing him sleep beside me occured a few times at night. I can't sleep well since I'm always seeing shadow and I'm easily startled and also I feel pretty paranoid as soon as some stranger looks at me just a second too long. I tend to see small dots of blackness or light swoosh by my eyes, like bugs from now and then.

Now, most of that I did'nt tell the doctors because I thought it's just my brain doing weird stuff or me being simply a bit paranoid, but could it be there's more than just my depression? It scares me a bit, to be honest...Another thing about the kid visiting family in Africa: Read something very interesting years ago about how psychiatrists need to be careful about diagnosing schizophrenia in people from certain - can't remember which - African cultures, who report hearing/seeing people who have passed away. The way we experience life is largely culturally bound and apparently in some cultures it is deemed  part of normal life to commune with the spirits of dead people in this way, and thus is not thought of as mental illness (when they are the only symptoms, anyway), but rather a societal influence. I’ve never admitted this to anyone until just now: I also through my early teens had invasive thoughts that I had sold my soul to the devil. Any thought of something I wanted was followed by “would you sell your soul for it”. I thought I was going crazy and never talked to anyone about it because it was so bizarre but it haunted me deeply and made me so unhappy. Having the same thought over and over again without being able to stop is the fucking worst This could be more OCD right? I have a little of these, only mild.Alarm bells go off for me in thinking that the thoughts you're describing as a kid were anxiety, not actual psychosis... Super interesting, and must have been so scary :(Thanks for commenting this I have anxiety and am often scared I'll go insane and this thread is like pandora's box for me.I think you're arguing that perhaps nowadays we overdiagnose people.  I know for me though being diagnosed with my mental health issue was a big relief, because it meant what was wrong with me could be externalised.  It wasn't *me* it was the disease, and it could be treated. 

Even if the kid grows out of it, it could be comforting for him to know there is something that can be done and it is understood and he is not alone. I can relate! I'm pretty sure I suffered PTSD as a child due to reasons totally beyond anyones control, and was severely bullied through school.

The walking in a very specific way (4 steps at a time, counting, never stepping on cracks), bedtime anxiety combined with sleep paralysis (which I still have now) and hypnogogic hallucinations, and a crippling fear of being too in control of situations.

I'm in my 30s now, and apart from some social anxiety these days I'm pretty good. Looking back, I was a pretty strange kid, though! >* I believed that I had influence/control over things I had no control over. If I wanted something too much, or was too excited for something, it would specifically not happen

Woah there. I'm 34 and this has been true all my life. I remember figuring out in 2nd grade that if I  really want something to happen like getting picked or hired then I can't  focus on it.  Now I say to myself  "that would be cool if that happens, but if not - whatever" 

Given that my childhood was very similar to yours and the fact it never progressed eventually going away I'm going to go with a form of obsession which is what I originally concluded allowing me to walk away from that nearly 20 years ago.I just wanted to say thank you for posting this, you've made twenty years of anguish a little less heavy. This is really interesting, as I have experienced half of or almost all of these things (the devil trading deal, the never walk on the space in between the tiles or on the cracks, the control or no control over things etc). For me, I always tried to make sense of it all and the way I see it is that the brain is sometimes an entity of its own. If the brain is bored it will try and fill in the white noise or the blank thoughts with something. 

For instance, if I was driving and the brain was bored it would ask me what if we just went off the road into another oncoming car? I would hear the voice talking to me, but I always attributed it to the brain and not to an "unknown source" another thing is that while I was alone sometimes I would hear certain noises and think fucked up thoughts, but then I would also have some "pleasant" thoughts in the "what if scenarios". 

Like I would start thinking out of the blue what life would be like if I had superpowers, what people I would punch to death if I was strong as Superman, or if I could go invisible what sexy actress I would spy on. There would be a lot of talking with the voices but I always brushed it off as the brain being bored and just talking to "me" even though we are the same person.

I also believe that rationalizing that things were not in my control and that some things were preordained to happen made my mind not lose its shit. Like people are scared to go out and get a drink because somebody might kill them, because everyone is against them blah blah, but what I did was I told myself that if I was supposed to die that day, death would find another way to get me so I might as well go out and enjoy my last night. 

That would kind of help me stay at ease, and naturally I grew out of all the negative thinking "what if scenarios" and today I do have some of the bits and pieces of that kind of thinking but again I consider it the fact that the brain is bored and just needs to talk to somebody and it does so with me if nobody is around. Feels kind of scary if you want to trip yourself in that way, but for me it's just normal I guess. 

It does sound more like OCD. Have you heard of scrupulosity? It's a type of OCD that revolves around religious and moral obsessions. My OCD never manifested as the stereotypical clean freak thing you see on TV. Had the 'sell your soul' thing too. > I believed that I had influence/control over things I had no control over. If I wanted something too much, or was too excited for something, it would specifically not happen


> Like you, I used to walk a very specific way, making sure I never stepped on any cracks, and, preferably, stepped with my left foot first


Fuck. I do these, still. Every since I was a child and I'm 29 now. I thought it was more of an "OCD" type thing, but could it be??Your comment and all these that followed is super relieving happy to have stumbled upon it. Growing up I had the same devil fixation. My parents really didn't understand it as I would tell them I'm a terrible person and the devil is going to take me and they would ask what have I done wrong and really I hadn't done anything but if I had bad thoughts I immediately felt it coming.

 I couldn't sleep at night and hated the dark. They sent me off to a summer camp at a local medical campus for two weeks during the summer. I tended to settle down while there but upon returning home within a few weeks it was back. After a few years it finally just kind of faded. I still occasionally have a night once or twice a year where it returns but in general I am now good.

As for other lasting effects I don't do scary movies and particularly demons, devils, etc. as I fear it could trigger it. Aside from disappointing a few dates its not particularly a big deal. I feel like I constantly need music and lyrics will replay in my head all day, totally fine I now honestly use it to DJ. 

I also tend to get very fixated on things and run things like what I have said and my behaviors through my mind, sometimes feeling guilty for things I said after the person I said them to have long forgot them and when you think about it are really no big deal. It doubles as decent introspection but probably isn't healthy. 

Finally I do have this strange fascination with geometric patterns. While driving I will draw imaginary lines between road signs, lamp posts on opposite sides of the road and then back again basically creating an imaginary zig zag line over and back across the road and when I think my car is on the line between the two objects I do like a minor head nod. I doodle geometric patterns whenever bored. Very strange but has no real impact on my ability to function. I relate to a lot of the things people have said here about their odd childhood beliefs/behaviours (I used to see hands coming out from between the bed and the wall to grab at me, and a shadowy figure standing in the doorway to my room at night, and thought that people could read my thoughts through the back of my head and was terrified of odd things like lavatory cubicles.) 
Just this year (I'm 40) got diagnosed with Aspergers. And I was raised by my single mother who wasn't diagnosed with the same until she was past 60. I always feared I would develop Schizophrenia one day. The overlap is really interesting, but it's comforting to know that it wasn't just me. For people trying to come up with a diagnosis based on the symptoms they are seeing in your post, just dont. Theres a lot of overlap in various mental health disorders. You can see some of the same symptoms in schizophrenia as you do in bipolar disorder. Its no simple thing to peg a diagnosis. You need to be evaluated by a healthcare professional and even then there are still significant challenges. 

I think the biggest reason the case study has a diagnosis of schizophrenia is because of the auditory hallucinations. That's pretty hallmark. That said, I think it would be more convincing if we knew if the case study also experienced negative symptoms. Holy shit the “sell your soul” and “cracks” thing is exactly what I experienced as a young child (around the age of 7). I lived in constant fear and constantly had to do the impulses in my head (touch the door 3 times, walk a certain way).

The “sell your soul” thing happened after I watched Anastasia the animated movie and Rasputin sells his soul to the devil. I grew up religious so I thought that if I just thought “I sell my soul to the devil” then it would happen. As silly as that sounds, it was absolute torture thinking and truly believing this.

I too grew out of it. Looking back, I always assumed I had a weird case of childhood OCD.

I’ve since never had any OCD tendencies from what I know. Did go through a very impulsive drug phase. I have suffered from depression (mostly due to drug use) and have some small anxiety problems (occasional panic attacks).This is fascinating....have you ever read about PANDAS? It seems like so much of what you describe is more like OCD than schizophrenia. My brother is schizophrenic, but when I was a child I had VERY similar thoughts/behaviors as what you describe, and I also "grew out of it." As an adult (about 10 years ago), I was online one day and an article caught my eye. I opened it and read, and got that deep, full-body chill that you get when something hits *really* close to home. It was about PANDAS and it just- oh my God, answered SO many questions I had about that period of my life....I realize the syndrome/diagnosis is somewhat controversial, but iIcan tell you that, based on my experience, I have NO doubt that it's a real thing. You should do some reading on it. No idea if it fits, but it just might.....Thanks for sharing!  I experienced a similar thing when I was a kid.  My parents divorced when I was ten and there was a stretch of time afterward where whenever I would go to bed I literally shivered in terror and cried for hours, worry about literally everything, fires, monsters, burglars, diseases, you name it.  I dreaded the time when I had to go to bed and lay there with no distractions and my mind free to contemplate everything horrible in existence.  

I can’t even describe how horrible of a time it was for me, but then one day I had... I guess a sort of paradigm shift and realized it was stupid to worry about that stuff and it was like a huge weight was lifted off of me.

It wasn’t until recently that I realized the timing of that whole episode, right after my parents’ divorce, probably wasn’t a coincidence.  It’s good to read that other people experience similar things.

As a kid I had some other issues too, even before the divorce like night terrors/sleep walking or bizarre things would scare the living hell out of me, and that weird “if I want something too much the universe won’t let me have it,” thing that seems to be fairly common... but I guess insecurity and weird notions about the way the world works is part of growing up, at least to some extent.  

I don’t really feel like I have any major issues nowadays other than some social anxiety, so I guess it could be hard to diagnose kids with early onset disorders.  



That poor kid. I am so sorry to hear that. ;(That sounds like a really awful and confronting situation to be in, I'm really glad to hear you have an awesome group of friends. That makes sense. Psychedelic drug use has no doubt played a role as well. And before the age of modern medicine, bizarre mental phenomenon was probably often attributed to spirits or demon possession because there simply was no other way of explaining it.

More generally, we don't like mystery and struggle to find patterns to make sense of the world, even if it means making stuff up. I recently got to see a total solar eclipse and it was an incredible experience even knowing the scientific explanation for it - I can only imagine how such an event would be perceived 2,000 years ago. Paul and his siezure on the road to Damascus... Convinced dead Jesus spoke to him. Jesus' family wrote him many letters asking him to cease and desist because he was spouting crazy stuff that Jesus never intended..  but he countered that he had spoken to him directly.. so nah. 

Yup. 
I tried to find a free full text but could only find the abstract, sorry. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2375440 Haha so much, to be honest!That sounds like a massive experience, I'm sorry it happened to you. I'm so glad you found answers, I hope you can find a forum or group of people with the disorder who are on the same page. 

The forums seem a bit quiet. https://www.psychforums.com/reactive-attachment/That's really interesting, thank you for the link! IBS is a funny one, due to its high prevalence in people with anxiety and depression. You hear about how IBS could be psychosomatic, like how nervousness causes butterflies in the stomach. But then you hear about how dysfunctional serotonin receptors in the gut have a shared aetiology with dysfunctional serotonin receptors in the brain, and wonder if it's all part of the same syndrome. That sounds very confronting. It doesn't sound stupid at all. I'm not sure about the situation, is it possible for you to contact someone over the phone if you cannot discuss it in person? In Australia there is Lifeline (13 11 14), SANE (1800 18 7263), Kids Helpline (1800 55 1800) and MensLine (1300 78 99 78).We haven't had shared hallucinations; her presentation was very different to mine. But definitely! Congratulations on nearing the finishing line! Thank you so much.Researchers would know much better than I, but hesitant yes to all of the above. The hygiene hypothesis has been implicated in mental illness, but it's a relatively new concept and field that hasn't been well explored. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18328783Yeah, I feel that. 

I've seen a minority of mental health workers act unprofessional and dehumanizing towards patients. But I've also seen a minority of patients become violent and cruel to staff members, while in a mental state where they know the difference between right and wrong. It can be hard to help people who won't help themselves, and it's hard to be a vulnerable patient. Psychiatric wards feel like a power keg waiting for a lit match, sometimes. I guess we just have to try and be the best versions of ourselves from both ends. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2375440I'm very fortunate that I have no history of that hallucination type. There's a lot of great literature around second order and command hallucinations if you want to read further. 

I compare mental conditions to physical conditions sometimes because they have similarities. You're describing a 'what if' scenario. I might be a diabetic, and diabetes is a strong risk factor for stroke, heart attacks, kidney failure, and vision loss. As a doctor with diabetes I might be in the middle of doing CPR on a person in cardiac arrest on the emergency ward one day, then suddenly stop, collapse, and have a stroke. That impacts on the care of the patient who is in cardiac arrest, but it's also very, very unlikely. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/2375440/Only when I was younger. As in 'insight'? In psychiatry, insight describes somebody who for example, hallucinates their deceased grandfather is in their living room but knows it's not true. They're aware it's not reality. Someone who lacks insight, would believe their deceased grandfather was genuinely standing in their living room. 

I lacked insight when I was severely unwell and was frightened by some incidents, yeah. But after about the age of 16, I realized they were ultimately just false perceptions.  Autistic people tend to have more digestive problems than neurotypical people, and their gut flora (iirc) is different from neurotypical people's. 
I think lots of parents of autistic kids make their children go through special diet treatment, somethings it works, most of the time it doesn't. There are lots of research papers about this, you might want to check them out Wow that sounds like it was a terrifying experience... Hope you're doing much better now! Would sleeping with noise cancelling headphones help in a situation like this?In my psych degree they gave a pretty good explanation for a lot of "supernatural" incidents. For example, sleep paralysis for alien abductions. Your perception is not absolute reality. You fill in blanks in your vision, your memory, it's incredible. 

If you're interested, I'd recommend "The man who mistook his wife for a hat".Not all of it. There is a reason most "supernatural scary phenomenas" take place at night. You don't really need to have a mental illness to hear and "see" things that aren't there at night. 

Part of it is, because we rely heavily on our eyes and these sensors are next to useless at night. So our brain trys two things: a) making sense of low visual impulses by making them something you know ("must have been a person" etc) and b) it strenghens your other senses making you hear things that would normaly blend in (cracking wood etc). So you hear something, think you saw something and your brain tells you "there must be something" but when you go look; nothing is there. 

People are also easier to jump to bad conclusions when their senses are blocked. It's like when someone covers your eyes and leads you to a surprise. Most people start walking funny because they get the sensation of being about to run into something. 
It's the brain being overly careful, because your most important sense is blocked and otherwise you might not react quickly enough when real harm's on its way.

Now, people didn't know how the brain worked. So they didn't know that what they were sure they saw was really just their brain trying to work around the darkness and be prepared. So they explained it with something like ghosts and monsters. 

Metally sick people are also not the majority of people and weren't usually trusted. When someone claimed he saw something that no one else saw, people didn't think: "He's probably right, there must be a ghost in the corner, only I don't see it". They thought: "Dude is possessed, better hit him until the demon comes out"As well as religion, which is essentially a type of ghost story: yes.  "So you say you saw a burning bush which talked to you?  And it told you to do things or you would be punished?  Go on..."  EXACTLY what I’m thinking.funny, I thought your exact quote 1 second before I read it.I was thinking the exact same thing!No person with a normal mind sees that. Idk how you thought everyone else did for so long. Seek help.Are they just like extra random people in a crowd?I would assume imagined as that's the topic here. I think actually you don't have to have a mental disorder to get hallucinations when you're severely sleep deprived. That alone is enough to cause them.don't worry, that's pretty normal when you're tired. Or at least, I have this too, I'm schizophrenia age, I've told this to many psychiatrists, psychologists and therapists and none thought it was cause for concern. Of course, you could go and ask one yourself if you want to be absolutely sure, but I really think you're fine[removed][removed][removed]Yes what the fuck were we thinking opening this thread at such an hour...Lets just hope your child’s bed doesn’t try to do anything to youCan i share something? My mum and i are both scared of the dark and my dad worked away a lot. When it gets dark go through every room. Check under the beds, in the closet, make sure every door and window are locked. Close the blinds and now you know the house is safe and secure. If you get scared you know for a fact that the house is secure.  Sleep with a light on if you need to and maybe get a dog. Hugs.My 9 year old is afraid of the dark and I let him know he's safe but it's normal to get weirded out by the dark as one of the senses you rely on is quite, if not totally impaired/dulled. 

I am 37 and genuinely think fearing the dark is pretty normal even for adults. I don't mean that adults walk around thinking Skeletor is in their closet (one of my personal nemesises (sp?!)) just that it's harder to know what is going on around you clearly in the dark. It's a vulnerable feeling. Just pile two mattresses on top of each other instead of having a bed frame.  Problem solved.  

No creepy bitches are gonna hide inside of your mattress, that shit is too uncomfortable.  21 yr old who still sleeps with a lamp on. 
I find myself struggle with sleeping without someone I trust in the room. I need lights on if I dont have another person or I'll be far too afraid of hallucinations. One of my worst experiences happened about a week after I tried salvia.(I know... Im dumb) essentially drove my car into a ditch trying to avoid someone on the road. I had been seeing people all over in the woods to the side of the road and then they they started getting closer and closer to the road. I had called my friend to comfort me as I was omw home and was just telling her where I was, as she was trying to help. She ended up coming out in the middle of the night to save me from what very well might of lead to suicide attempt by me.


Im so paranoid somedays, I absolutely refuse to watch scary movies ever as they just put me even further on edge for weeks at a time. I'm in a dark room nursing my baby down to sleep. I just turned the flashlight on on my phone Bc I'm all freaked out now 😂> "don't worry I'm **not** going to kill your mom"

I don't have an underneath to my bed and I'm still scaredIt's okay, it said it's NOT going to kill you. Do what I do and go to bed at 6AM.Works night's what? Since we're both on this thread it might not be so weird.  

I had a mental breakdown a few years ago but through that I ended up rebooting or something.  I was also really afraid of the dark, but in my state I thought I was a Shaman.  So I danced in my room to The Doors  When the Musics Over as I imagined my room on fire.

I can't sleep with any light on now.  Which sucks because I have a flea infestation currently and I'm trying the flea lamp traps.  You are not scared of the dark, you are scared of what is in the dark.Don't worry, no one is under there.....Night night!

: )> momwhose 


I misread that as momwhore.

Thankfully I'm not schizophrenic.

God only knows what my voices would be saying to me.[removed]There are some schizophrenics that have almost exclusively positive experiences, but from my understanding we don't focus on them because they are more rare than those with neutral or negative episodes, and their lives aren't impacted as much.

I can't remember where I read it, but a paper I read stated that schizophrenics in the US and Europe were more likely to have negative experiences than schizophrenics in Africa and Asia, who were more likely to have positive or neutral experiences. The paper implied that there might be something about culture or language that changes how schizophrenia effects individuals.My friend has mostly positive schizophrenic voices and MPD.https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/07/when-hearing-voices-is-a-good-thing/374863/Seems to be cultural. IIRC, schizophrenics in some cultures hear almost exclusively positive voices. They attribute it to their ancestors helping them or whatever. In the west and the US specifically, I guess we're kind of culturally wired to assume stuff like that is malevolent. To us, spirits or disembodied voices, etc, are always evil. They're evil ghosts or whatever. Just how they're portrayed in the vast majority of the media. 

In some places, for instance several asian countries, voices or spirits or ghosts have traditionally been seen as helpful or good or at least not evil. [deleted]Sometimes I do...[deleted]Hypnagogic hallucinations?[deleted][deleted]Although I have never believed or thought there are people listening or watching, I have been monitoring my thoughts and what I do while alone **just in case**I have this feeling all the time, too, since I was a kid. I always felt like people could hear what I was thinking, even though I knew intellectually that this could not be so. I don't get it as much anymore, but it's definitely still there, lingering. This isn't normal? I thought this was normal. Shit[removed]I don't think I'm schizophrenic, but when I was going through puberty, I thought people had access to my private life some how. I have a memory of thinking a camera was in the bathroom.  It could have been some thought process that came up by watching "The Truman Show", Idk. Growing up is weird, so many hormones. I actually became more disciplined because of it though, so maybe it was a good thing?This scares me. My brother sometimes acts with schizophrenic tendencies and ive always had this thought. I wonder if i have a much more mild/minor version of what he has. I also always feel as though people are plotting against me. 😕 i know this isnt the case and i generally get over it and im fairly socially successful but id hate for it to get worse without me realizing it.Your response has my mind racing. My brother has schizophrenia. My mom's side of the family has always been a little crazy all the way down the line, to include some semi high profile criminals, so I figure it runs in the family. Several years ago my brother started hearing voices through the wall which he thought was me plotting on him. He has thought I followed him across state lines on trips. He is 10/10 paranoid and we no longer speak to each other. I, on the other hand, experience what you describe. An intense feeling of judgement on my private thoughts. Being coached by something that feels deeper than just an inner monologue. Suppressing compulsions and feelings. I'm wondering if I'm experiencing the other side of the same coin. Wait... is that feeling a symptom of schizophrenia? 

Fuck.Wow. This is fkn scary how spot on I relate to this. Schizophrenia runs in my family and ive been really scared I have it. Since I was 11 years old when I got a brand new dresser that 2 men from the store came to deliver while I was at school. I was TERRIFIED they put a camera INSIDE my mirror or somewhere around my room. Ever since, 21 now I ALWAYS feel like there's a camera on me. Either in vents, fire alarms, motion sensors, etc. There was a small splatter of grey paint on my ceiling and I had to get VERY close to inspect and make sure it wasn't a tiny microchip camera hiden in my bedroom. Constantly scared someones out to get me or hurt me. I also sometimes get the feeling that my thoughts are being heard, that i'm actually a movie that people are watching on tv making fun of. I have to check to make sure my door is locked, 3,4,5 times even tho I know I already locked it. Just yesterday I heard my own voice in my head and a totally other voice speak over my own voice. That has never happened. I usually will just argue with myself but I could never have 2 thoughts at once? Ugh I've had this one. I always feel that people who I'm touching can feel my thoughts and subtly respond to them. Cuddling with a girl while I'm thinking about a x girlfriend or something? They 100% know and resent me for it. It usually goes away after a couple months but it's damn invasive when it's happening. I...this is schizophrenia?Diagnosed bipolar, not schizo. Same for me, much worse when i'm manic. It's gotten pretty manageablr in recent years but i wasn't very functional in my early 20s.I’m not joking but this is exactly me when I’m high on marijuana. If I’m laughing I feel like I laugh so much that I feel like I might die of a heart attack. But if I go into that thought spiral, each and every thought goes into a deeper level of thought. Most of it actually does make sense the next morning when I wonder why I haven’t made these conclusions earlier. Some also seem like subconscious paranoia that rise up to the surface because of marijuana. Whatever it is, it does not feel good. And having a phone nearby makes it so much worse! The things my mind can thing about!My dad had schizophrenia. He has Alzheimer's and one of the last coherent sentences he would say, over and over, is "The people there are watching me." He can't talk anymore, and always seems afraid, with his jaw clenched and hands in fists so tight his nails cut his palms. I think the watchers are still there for him.I can relate so much to this it hurtsHow did you learn to limit the amount of influence? I suffer from chronic anxiety and cant get ahold of my thoughts. It started when I️ was 12 and had just been sent to live in another country. It’s been an off and on issue through my life always there but sometimes more present then others. 

I️ know it’s not real. I️ don’t typically tell people, but I️ still really believe that my life is almost like a tv show. That there’s producers controlling my life and that the people in my life are actors. And I️ know logically that it can’t be real, but sometimes I️ can’t believe it’s not. I relate to this. I have similar thoughts and ended up having OCD. If it ever gets too overbearing, maybe seek treatment. It helped me, personally.That's funny, I know I'm always being watched... so i won't do anything rash, I'll just focus on science and making the world betterFunny enough in our modern world you are more accurate than not.I've had this, although, to my knowledge I've never been schizophrenic, when I was a teenager I used to think people could read my mind and always felt I was being watched and had to sit with my back against a wall because I always felt something was behind me.So if I felt this way....what should I do to make it stop? I don't like the feeling of being watched....very unsettling....and the policing of myself is stressful and overbearing sometimes....

I always have felt this way but never thought it to be that serious....but then again hearing and believing these things is just as serious in the first place

Do I seek help? Medication? Better lifestyle? Young me became real irritated with this "For whatever reason I am being watched while alone". I still think I could be being watched, yet it don't bother me. I talk to myself as if there was an audience, I find it entertaining. I don't have hallucinations though, could I be ill?

edit: Oh when alone at night I have sometimes gotten the strangest feeling that someone is standing behind me. Once spent a whole night with that feeling, carried a weapon on hand. I looked into 'paranoia' the next day learning aboot it. Creepy stuff.Never diagnosed but i distinctly remember being convinced at a young age that my parents were aliens and had cameras planted around the house. The belief that others can understand my thoughts has never gone away. Had a psychotic episode in college where i heard a voice telling me to kill myself.The "there's always someone watching" feeling is to an extent inherited by every human and it's a necessary part of our imagination, it help with thinking about how individuals in our group would react to your thoughts/actions and thus whether we should carry them out, it's also a form of empathy to allow for us to better align our mentality with that of the group.



Slight off topic:

That's why (among other things), massive surveillance is so dangerous, our thoughts literally change when we know we are being watched... even if we rationally now the video camera is unable to read our minds, we start acting as if we were surrounded by people, shift our thoughts to things to say/do that we know are socially acceptable.What the fuck? I used to censor my thoughts in school because I thought people were listening. I used to sit in assembly and think "I know that you can hear me." and look for whoever in the room reacted.Is this an indicator of schizophrenia? I've felt similar to this for as long as I can remember, in that I'm always feeling like my thoughts are somehow able to be listened to. I also *think* I sometimes see things that aren't there but I'm not sure if I do or if I just think that I did.Oh shoot, is this a sign? I have this usually when I'm high and occasionally when sober. I quit bud, for about 4 years now, but occasionally smoke still and would have this. This was actually one of the main reason why I quit. It got too real and scary and couldn't take it anymore.Bit personal this, seen as I've never really said anything to anyone, but I've always had the feeling that the kids that used to pick on me would be standing just beyond the wall at the back of my garden, judging my every moment.  Maybe there's a touch of schizophrenia going on there?

I've never done well when high - always suffered quite bad paranoia.  And I'm sure auditory hallucinations have been a recurring, if not frequent, thing.

TIL (maybe)>All of my thoughts are being monitored in some way.

I feel for the person who has to monitoring my thoughts. Probably traumatized the first day.IFS Therapy can really really help with this. I guarantee it, I persisted and it really changes the way these "people" in your head work.

Google it and find someone in your area who practices IFS Therapy +GerriBird - i have this exact thing - i cant be myself or live anywhere near my potential because of how stupid i think and act from knowing.. er.. thinking people are always watching me and listening to my thoughtsWait, I have the same thing. I always think someone can read my mind, like my thoughts are being uploaded into a chat room for all to see. Like everyone can talk telepathically but not me. 
Also I never trust anyone, I always think anything I tell anyone will be used against me and if I tell someone a private secret I get the idea and urge to kill them to keep it secret because I'm scared it will be released. I saw a doctor when I was 16, I'm 17 now but nothing appeared wrong, then again I don't know if I answered honestly. Another thing that I have that this thread is making me rethink is that I sometimes (rarely) hear things like a door opening or my cat but when I check its nothing. I always thought this thinking process was normalWhen I was very young I remember being told that someone is always watching, they said it to try and get me to stop picking my nose or something but I really took it too literally. I'm my early 20's now and I feel like I'm being watched all the time everywhere, especially bathrooms, the vents above the stalls.I hate this. I never had the feeling subconsciously, rather I imposed it on myself as a kid so I wouldn't think anything "inappropriate", now I'm never comfortable thinking anything. My brother committed suicide about a month ago and he was so “normal” except he would sometimes talk about how the FBI was going to take him away and we were never going to see him again. He had mentioned seeing drones (hallucinations?) in he sky following him around all day. Whenever we told him “these are just thoughts, do you have a picture of these drones?”, it seemed like he would snap out of it and come back to reality. But at the same time you got the feeling he still believed those things deep down. 

I’m starting to wonder if he had paranoid schizophrenia...

He had taken a variety of medicines and some imo had helped him but when he did it he was not on medicine. I theorize that in the future all schizophrenic sensations will be explainable as spiritual sensitivity. ie: the person is over-tuned into other phenomena that is all around us whereas most people filter that stuff out.
I believe that there are spiritual entities / energies all around us and schizophrenic chemical imbalance 'allows' a person's brain to activate otherwise dormant 'senses'.

I could be wrong though.[deleted]Holy shit. Thought I was alone on this one. Not schizophrenic but when I was a kid I was thought that my neighbor across the street had a camera in my bathroom and was watching me. So it's like there's a switch in your head that normally tells you that something is being portrayed (like emotions on your face), and something is being hidden (like your thoughts), and that switch is broken?Man sometimes I pretend to see something in the window at night. For some reason I think it’ll scare people watching me?? I dunno it’s weridThat's normal in my opinion.  It's why I won't use Venetian blinds and always opt for blackout curtains.Is your name Truman?So I used to do this a lot before I realized that nobody can monitor your thoughts. Do I have schizo?As a parent of a young child, I'm terrified: was this some strange parental thing to get you to behave when they weren't around? i wonder, did some church convince you that a god was always watching ?Fuck. Wait does this mean you have a mental health issue?? Ever since I was a kid that feeling has always been with me. And I constantly have this low set fear of what people would think of me from my thoughts, and seeing my actions behind closed doors. I feel shame over stupid simple shit like scratching my ass crack...when I'm in my own bed..under my covers. Same with masturbation. I can't do it without hiding myself with a cover or during a shower. I feel like I'm somehow being disgusting and...fuck I don't even know the right words for it. Rationally looking at it right now there is no sense behind it. What name could be given to those feelings of shame? Sometimes I have to blurt out to myself "fucking Christ Nicole no one can see you just stop it" 

Am I broken?Uh oh, I've had thoughts like this when I was younger and sometimes still do.I think that is more of just a worry thing though. I've had the same thing and everyone I have ever told about it relates to it.I get a "feel" that some people stare at me too much and it pisses me off sometimes... I kinda sense that theyre looking at me. Is this (or could it be) a weaker version? I also got depression and anxiety after moving to my home country for the first time. Not sure if they are related at all..Very much how it feels to have lsd paranoia, exactly how it feels to have lsd paranoia.I experienced this as a kid as well. I even had 2 hallucinations  But I grew out of it. Is this normal?A sense of an imaginary audience is pretty common among people in generalThis is schizophrenia? ShitJesus is watching you masturbate.My daughter has this and has been prescribed some drugs but I would love it if there were a different way for her to handle this. What has your experience been?Hello! I'm a high-functioning schizophrenic and I'd like to try to give you a little more insight than the non-schizophrenic people who responded to you.

First, it is absolutely possible to be high-functioning with schizophrenia in the same way it's possible to be high-functioning with depression or an eating disorder or any kind of mental illness. If you can go to school or work, maintain normal relationships, take care of your daily tasks (eating, showering, errands, etc), then you don't really need treatment. There are actually a surprising amount of high-functioning schizophrenics. However, many of us will claim to have depression or anxiety when asked about it because the stereotype of schizophrenia is this horror-movie trope where you're babbling in a corner by yourself. Just look at the responses to you in this thread telling you to rush to a doctor immediately and consider medication. Many people simply don't understand that you can have schizophrenia and look and work and live just like everyone else.

Second, mental disorders are called disorders because they cause disorder in your life. You can have a symptom or two without having a full-blown disorder. Diagnosis for psychiatric disorders actually hinges on whether it affects your life. In the DSM-5, a schizophrenia diagnosis requires "For a significant portion of the time since the onset of the disturbance, one or more major areas of functioning such as work, interpersonal relations, or self-care, are markedly below the level achieved prior to the onset." Contrary to popular belief, having a hallucination doesn't mean that you immediately need anti-psychotics. And, it's completely possible to have daily hallucinations yet not receive a schizophrenia diagnosis because the hallucinations don't interfere with the rest of your life.

If you find yourself withdrawing from the world, unable to meet your goals, or failing to achieve the same functioning you previously had, then yes, you should absolutely talk to a therapist and/or psychiatrist and explore your options for reclaiming your life. However, having hallucinations or odd beliefs is not automatically a brick wall that prevents you from having a normal life.

EDIT: This is my account for talking about schizophrenia, so feel free to go through my comment history if you'd like to learn more about my experiences and schizophrenia in general.So many undiagnosed schizophrenics in this thread...I tried for the on-campus non-sleep record when I was at uni.  Made it to 109 hour without drugs or insomnia, not even coffee.

At about 80 hours, I started losing my grip on reality.  I would look at still images, and they'd move.  Just discreetly - a wink, or a dress would lazily wave in the wind.  I'd even see shadows changing on people's torsos as they breathed.  At 90, I started hearing things.  In the computer lab, I'd ask who was playing that cool music - the only sound was the fans on a bank of iMacs in the back row.
At 100, I started seeing shadows walking around.  Eyestalks would pop up out of the ground, look around, then disappear back under again before I got close (they looked like the trash compactor thing in Star Wars, that grabs Luke).

Aaaand I think that's as close to schizophrenia as I'd like to get.
It could be schizophrenia, it could not be. You have no way of knowing without talking to a psychologist. 

I would say, if we realize anything from this thread, we are all very close to losing our minds no matter how "normal" you are. Sleep deprivation can cause serious hallucinations, especially shadow people.  Source: MethFormer cop here. Read that again, cop. Not mental health professional.

I'd seek some professional advice if I were you. There are a lot of people that live very productive lives with schizophrenia, if it's properly managed.

However many people don't have proper management. From my experience, it can be difficult for an inexperienced or improperly trained officer to tell the difference between someone who is under the influence of drugs or an innocent person going through a psychotic break.  So what you get is a person who needs help, who belongs in a hospital, being in jail. 

Not trying to scare you, but do your own research on schizophrenia and breaks. A break can happen any time. Get ahead of it as best you can. If it is indeed a disorder, no need to be ashamed. Way more folks have it than you'd think. Just make it part of your life, your reality, and embrace it.

But please, see someone. Breaks are scary for everyone and can happen out of the blue to perfectly normal people.I had the same thing as a kid until maybe my late teens.... these two people watching me from outside, cameras in the vents, hearing strange noises in other rooms. I even remember telling a therapist about it (was at therapist for other reasons). It never really amounted to anything. It freaked me out like how kids are afraid of the boogeyman or what’s under the bed, but never affected life otherwise. My mom always attributed it to an overactive imagination.

I haven’t thought about this in years... I constantly ask if my girlfriend said something and get a no from her. I have also seen shadows in the corner of my eye but not just while driving. In actuality in the past seeing that stuff got me really into what djinn were even though it’s silly it was still interesting. I have a history of mental illness in my family but just my mom. I always thought it was her recovering from drugs and not something I could get. This really sketches me out to be honest and reading this is thread is making me wonder if I have been hiding symptoms from myself and just brushing them off. I'd pay attention to it.. if it's severe it's definitely worth getting checked out. Mild hallucinations are fairly normal if you're really tired, stressed, or on certain meds. (For instance, I've noticed an uptic in visual hallucinations while on migraine preventatives, but they're minor and worth the benefits so eh.) I've always felt like I am being watched and I always assume I'm on camera. No visual or auditory though, although I do occasionally see things out of the corner of my eye and maybe some ringing in my ears. Am I schizophrenic or just hyper aware or maybe paranoid?Apparently it's somewhat common to think you barely hear things under the droning sound of something like a fan, especially if you are under slept of over caffeinated.

But the other stuff you mention is not normal... There may be a medicine that greatly improves your quality of life.describe thess shadow people?It's good to see I'm not alone with thinking someone is watching me or that there's video cameras in vents.  Schizophrenia has never once crossed my mind.I'm a little late to the thread but I'm sure you'll at least read this if no one else does.

Mental health is not like physical health. You see someone with an arm that is all mashed up you can assume their arm is injured. Mental health is a lot more complicated. 


Hallucinations aren't exclusive to one disorder. Visual and audio hallucinations are for example also common with Autism especially when the person is stressed or very upset. 

Mental health is a lot of spectrums and scales that share common issues and many are often also hyper normal so it's easy to worry about your mind when you're actually healthy. It's also why it's easy to read about some of the conditions and think it sounds familiar. 


If you are concerned it's always better to play it safe and talk to a professional/doctor but don't say what you think you have, say your symptoms. Let them piece the puzzle unless you have a family history. 


At the end of the day a diagnosis doesn't change who you are. It helps explain things to people and helps you know how to overcome issues but nothing really changes about you unless you let it. A diagnosis is more useful for low functioning people but for High Functioning you can learn some useful tips and advice once it has a name. How old are you? This play a big part into why you may have these hallucinations. Shizofrenia generally first comes up in the adolenscence. But other psychiatric deseases also have hallucinations as one of the symptoms.found the undiagnosed schizophrenic> That is not normal. Something is wrong. See a professional if you can

OP. people are asking for you to see a doctor.. if you do, update us.Damn that sucks. Keep an eye out on your kid too. It's hereditary. when i'm on the verge of falling asleep i sometimes hear short and loud sounds like a door slam or loud shout that shakes me back to fully awake. or if my eyes are open enough i'll see a red spider. 

i just looked it up and it's called exploding head syndrome apparently.This shadow people stuff would scare the *crap* out of me. Repeated exposure to stimuli in a the same location can lead to the brain thinking that it still experiences the stimuli in it's absence, in my experience anyway. Playing a video game for 6hrs and still hearing the soundtrack after you're done is a good example or maybe I'm schizophrenicNot schizophrenic.  The only shadow people I've ever seen was when I was extremely exhausted and suffering from sleep paralysis while watching a movie.How did you not realize that hearing a tv constantly isn't normal?Well, okay, have you actually been diagnosed? Or, in all of those situations you mentioned, are there static, white noises in the background?

The human brain can't make sense of static/white noise. So, it'll attempt to fill in the gaps. I know for myself, in certain noise contexts, I'll hear old GameBoy music playing (like from the original Red and Blue games). Doesn't matter that I haven't played those games since I was a kid, I still hear them sometimes.You can experience mild psychosis occasionally. I have from time to time had auditory hallucinations when I’m experiencing extreme stress. I have major depression and anxiety, not schizophrenia. If you can pinpoint a cause like stress you can try to make some lifestyle changes and the hallucinations won’t happen. My psychiatrist said antipsychotics are overkill since my hallucinations are so rare and mild.No it doesn't happen to most people.Not to be rude it’s not normal I haven’t thankfully experienced any of what you have described, I hope you seek help and live a happy life You invited me over though broIf this stuff is just mild and not impacting your well being or that of others, I wouldn't worry too much about whether it's "normal" or "happens to everyone". The point at which it becomes a disorder or a diagnosis is when it becomes severe enough to negatively impact your life (or others'). If your thoughts/feelings/sensory perceptions are preventing you from doing things you want to do or are otherwise undermining your life, then go see a doctor.

I think people's mental health in general would be a lot better if we approached other humans from less of a standpoint of "is this normal" and more of a "this is harming you or others". >That happens to everyone.

Uh, no it doesn't. One of my ex girlfriends complained about this problem before she was diagnosed. The sooner you get it checked on, the better off you'll be.There is research in Bergen, Norway on people who hear voices but have no psychiatric condition. They interpret the reality just fine, and know that what they hear is only in their head. [Link to abstract by Kenneth Hugdal](https://wo.cristin.no/as/WebObjects/cristin.woa/wa/personVis?type=PERSON&pnr=52765&la=no&action=sok) with the main sentence: *"These studies give reason to believe that the majority of individuals in the general population who hear voices are not in need of mental health care."*  

Wish this comment could be seen by all the people here being afraid of being mentally ill.Oh honey.......There is also such a thing as auditory hallucinations. That's not necessarily the same as schizophrenia. I have this thing once in a while where I'll hear a doorbell when Im sound asleep. I jolt awake and have to check the front door to see if anyone is there. Not sure what that's about but sure is annoying. I think it's an anxiety thing.At night when I lay down in bed and shut off the light, I often feel my cat jump onto my bed and stalk around me. For months I just assumed it was her, but I started trying to pet her and she's not even in the room when I turn on the light.I think it's pretty normal to hear stuff within loud noises... the brain is constantly trying to make sense of the noise.  If you stare at a wall long enough you'll hallucinate, almost like LSD.  I figured this out in "in school suspension" but apparently it's something prisoners and other folks have known for a long time.

The only time I've genuinely heard audio hallucinations is when my kids were newborns.  It's one of those weird quirks about parenting nobody tells you.  You get so used to keeping an ear our for their cries that you'll start to hear it *everywhere* even when you're at work, or they're at their grandparents.

Parents typically call these "ghost cries" and they can really fuck you up and your sleep to boot.  It seems like the longer you go without hearing their cries the more frequently  you'll hear it, making it damn near impossible to catch up on sleep when you finally get a sitter.
Its just important not to regard every quirk or situation experienced in stressful times as pathological. "Does it impact your everyday life and restricts you from doing something?" is a good question to gauge the scale.I'm epileptic and sometimes I'll have sensory seizures. They include sounds like a ringing cellphone, hearing breathing etc. sometimes I'll taste watermelon, fruit loops or just an odd metallic taste.

My ex with epilepsy used to see faces that would morph from an old man to a little girl to a teenaged boy etc. one time in my bedroom she saw a guy in a flannel red jacket walk through my wall.

Just because you hear and or see things doesn't necessarily mean it's schizophrenia.I have auditory hallucinations from time to time, but they don't really interfere with my life. A lot of the time I hear music in static or white noise like raindrops. Only a couple times did I ever hear voices.

I know a couple people who experience the same thing, but are scared to talk about it because people would think they're crazy. But it's just some kind of short circuit in the auditory part of your brain.

If it gets to the point that you start to feel menaced by it, absolutely seek help. If the voices tell you to do things or distrust people, or if they mock or taunt you, seek help. But if you just hear weird things sometimes, there are a lot of people who do experience that, more people than let on.Minor hallucinations aren't necessarily indicative to schizophrenia. Shit. Growing up, I was always apprehesive about opening the shower curtain because I literally thought I'd see Satan. Not a monster, or a creepy guy, Satan! I dunno why though. Sometimes when I'm dreaming, I'd suddenly hear a boom or a lion's roar that would shake me awake.

Pretty sure I'm not schizo though. That doesn’t happen to everyone. It all depends on how severe it gets I think. Everyone hallucinates at some time or another. It's got to do with how your brain interperates lights and sounds. Our brains work much faster than our conscious perception of our surroundings. Some times your brain's function gets away from youI used to hear my dog snoring behind the couch. I've never had a dog.

Also people talking like they were right outside my window. On the 3rd floor.

But yeah like some helpful dude(tte) said above, if it doesn't fuck up your life, don't worry. It doesn't happen to everyone actually.Pareidolia If I'm trying to fall asleep, I might here someone my name and it wakes me up. But hearing noises or voices that aren't there on a regular basis? No. That's not something that happens to everyone.How well do you sleep? I've had similar experiences from lack of sleep, or having a bad flu. After a night or two of no sleep I hear sounds and people shouting my name.I have many of those things. Hearing my name shouted seems to be my subconscious telling me that I have left something in a bad way, and my mind is feeling stresses about it.

The danger with all those kibd of  things is not hearing them, it is letting yourself outright believe them, which I think most often starts from being afraid of them.

Normalizing it is the best way I can see to actually stay sane, because nothing good can come from constantly spending ones energy in trying to suppress it.

Definitely does not happen to everyone.I think that’s all pretty normal. That happens to everyone.

Never happened to me....
I’ve heard random things in the past and I didn’t then, and don’t now, think it’s anything but normal. The clearest I can remember off the top of my head is I remember sitting in my bedroom and hearing someone say ‘Steven’ clear as day as though they were in the room with me. I don’t know anyone called Steven, it didn’t sound like it was shouted to have come from anywhere else, and yet I didn’t feel worried, I just figured I’d had a hallucination. If it’s interfering with your life then see someone but if not don’t worry about it too much. I don't hear any of these things... So this is probably not normal...I lived in a haunted house for 3 years. I don't know what was worse, being the only one hearing the breathing, or being in a room with two other people who also heard it and NO ONE being where it was coming from, not even one of my cats. 

Honestly, I kinda miss our ghost. He was weird and friendly. (Long story, search my history for a "Fred the stoner ghost" post if you want to learn more)It's not common at all. Please get help. thats pretty normal! don't worry about it unless it starts really getting to you or infringing on your functioning. "The worst is when I’m alone and I hear breathing. Like right now. That’s right, Satan, I can hear you. Back off, bitch."

That little part somehow made your story less believable. Throws off seriousness of your question.You should get this checked out. That's not a normal thing for people.I get them and its just OCD not schizoYou should be as seems to be the consistency here with things like this please get yourself checked Ignore the other person, you're probably fine. If anything like hallucinations starts interfering with your life though or becoming very common when you're not super tired, go see someone.I think you neeed to get tested after what you have described Do yourself, and your parents, a service and talk to a doctor.Better to have it checked out and dealt with in case it is a problem. Wouldn’t want it to get out of control.  I would want my kid to tell me so that I could help and know to keep an eye out.Okay I'm only 3 parent comments in and this thread is officially freaking me the fuck out.To play devil's advocate there are a lot of sounds that most houses have that, unless you are knowledgeable of your home's inner workings, you might not know what they are even though they occur in most homes.You're fine, if that's your only symptom. Stuff like that isn't uncommon.When you’re falling asleep that’s a hypnagogic hallucination. I get them when I’m extremely stressed out (not schizophrenic). I once heard a cell phone ring tone clear as day (Nokia bar phone style ring tone! lol). It never occurred to you? Where did you think it came from?What you thought random ethereal noises were real, and not hallucinations? LmaoI actually don’t mind if there is someone watching; I have nothing to hide.
I’m more so slightly irritated that I’ll never have the peace of mind knowing that I am completely, 100% alone and don’t have to worry about feeling guilty for masturbating or sleeping naked.I actually do that sometimes.
I don’t particularly care if they’re watching - I have nothing to hide. But I would like them to know that I know, even though there’s probably nothing in that vent.Why not get help? That sounds stressful.It’s like seeing something that is there, but with a rock of doubt in your belly.
I see them. Their clothes, their wrinkles. They walk. They jog. I hate it when they run, but they run.
I never notice their eyes. I guess that’s like the dream part where you don’t catch the small details. I never realize it until they’re gone though - that I never saw their eyes.If you are concerned even in he least bit I highly recommend speaking with a professional. I wish I had sought help when I was younger.
Best wishes. Stay safe.Some of them are real though. I see them and have no other symptoms. I thought I was going nuts but then twice my husband saw them before I had a chance to say anything. Exactly where I saw them... some shadow things are real.Yes I am ok when I take my medication. I have a job in the service industry.
I am very aware of my dx. I understand that sometimes the people I see aren’t real.
But what if they are? I will always be cautious just in case.I relate to this a lot.
Every fly, beetle, or spider was a little robot that was checking in on me.
I never had the heart to smash them though so I’d leave them be to do their thing, but I used to talk to them like people. Tell hem I know who they were and why they were here.
Every dog walker, jogger, and scooter kid had me on edge too. Employees sent to make sure I was obedient.I would sincerely recommend speaking to a professional.
I wish I had sought help when it was younger. It would have saved me a lot of relationships and headaches.
Best wishes, and stay safe.I’d recommend seeking help. I’d wish I sought help when I was younger. I could’ve saved a lot of relationships and headaches.
Stay safe.You should probably really go see a doctor asap.Thank you. You’re too kind.There’s more to it than this. This was just the beginning for me. But if you are having any concerns I would recommend speaking to a professional.
Stay safe.Not as much when I take medication. Friends and family help by pointing out that there is in fact, no one crossing the street or slamming doors.Don’t skip sleep. Not a good plan.They’re there.

I can never make out their distinct faces, but I see their clothes and their wrinkles. I never see their eyes though.
They only disappear when I get close or if they run.I was dx with schizoaffective disorder.

From what I understand, it’s common to hear weird things, especially at night.I'm almost sure that the cat thing is fairly normal, my dad still recites an old rhyme sing-song he made up when I was a baby. 

However, that thing with the hair reminds me of some of the things my traumatized family member does, as well as some of the things my mom has told me about (she worked at a psychiatric ward, don't get too concerned though, the people there had a *lot* of other issues far more severe than recurring thoughts). I'd talk to a doctor, just to be sure.It was some rap or hip hop sounds. I couldn’t make out any vocals I mostly just heard the loud beats with quiet, father sounding vocals.I remember seeing weird shadows on the school bus when I was a junior in high school. I’d see babies crawling in the street or weird dogs running but I never thought anything of it. Just being tired and seeing things you know?
The other symptoms(except paranoia) came when I entered my twenties. The hallucinations and auditory sounds, and the paranoia escalated drastically."You think therefore I am."If I were his hallucinations, I would have a serious existential crisis.

Sounds like that poor imaginary little girl in A Beautiful Mind.Basically his brain made a guy, then he realized dam my brain made that guy, and then his brain had the guy his brain made realize dam your brain made me. Makes sense actually.This seems like it could be a really heartwarming indie film. Hallucination!guy releases he's not real, but tries to care for schizophrenic anyway.What a nice hallucination guy.I know a guy who I still believe may not be real despite "knowing" he definitely is. He has schizophrenia himself and when I explained it to him, he understood and said he wasn't sure if he was real either. Nobody else got it and they found it insulting on his behalf, fortunately he did not. He always just stuck out from the fabric of reality like a loose thread and seemed to only appear when I needed him or under other specific circumstances. All of our interactions were weird and poignant.

Robert, I'm sure you're real. But prove it. I was trying lucid dreaming a few years ago. I actually got so far that I realized when I was dreaming. Once I dreamed about sitting in a van with a couple of friends. I told one of them that this is a dream and that he isn't real. He laughed at me. I couldn't convince him. Outside of the van an old train went by, with a huge log on top of its chimney, which didn't burn, but kept on exploding instead. Next thing, I saw a cow doing a handstand. I pointed out the cow. He still insisted it was all real.

I stopped trying lucid dreaming shortly afterwards.[deleted]Read the short story[Legion] by Brandon Sanderson, the main character has some kind of multi personality disorder (not sure, read it in my non English home language). And apparently I think he should accept that calmly, so he did. Yeah, took them a long time to stop freaking out when I get into arguments with my imagination. One of them, unfortunately the one I have a crush on, is still friends with me but is a bit scared of me now. #Brain, A poem by Brain. My best friend is schizoaffective and half her hallucinations are in a form of an imaginary friend because she needs someone to talk to.Fun fact: [All of our brains are actually two](https://youtu.be/wfYbgdo8e-8)I mean I'm still alive and all, just really struggling to be "normal" as I also have sociopathic symptoms. I can't act empathetic for example, but my logic tell me how empathric people act, and do that when I feel I need to. He is me if my sociopathic symptoms are taken to an extreme. Paranoid, emotionless, and always telling me to just kill a guy I don't like. The only times I’ve hallucinated without drugs are when I was falling asleep. I heard voices once, and I knew it was a hallucination; hypnogogic and hypnopompic hallucinations were mentioned in some of my neuro classes, so it was nice having some context for what was going on and I just thought it was cool.I had a similar experience after a similarly long, sleepless cram session studying and writing papers on a constant supply of ADD meds and energy drinks. Didn't have any visual hallucinations, or difficulty communicating, but did have auditory hallucinations - I was in the computer lab by myself and kept hearing just a din of voices, like I was in the middle of a small, mellow party or get-together where there were about a dozen or more people in small conversations but I couldn't quite make out what anyone was saying, just kind of idle background chatter. Strangely, it didn't freak me out, I just kind of figured, "hmm, guess I've overloaded my brain and probably need to take it easy on the stimulants." Glad that I wasn't prone to paranoia, or in a room with other real people, because it could have easily lent itself to thinking people might have been talking about me. Read later about amphetamine psychosis and that reinforced my resolve to avoid stimulant benders in the future.Yeah, but I don't see him persistently. He accepts himself as non existent, but still stuck around. I don't always see him, he just comes and goes randomly. I would wake up, see him downstairs waiting for me to cook(he eats from an empty plate, I visualize some food on it, and there they are.) and I wouldn't see him until, afternoon; then he will walk up to me as I'm trying to buy a cup of coffee. When I am extra tired I can see him pop into existence out of nothing. I have a friend like that, and sometimes we would have hallucinations simultaneously, and interestingly we will have the same reaction. Generally something along the line of "oh boy here we go again", then we will look at each other, and nod in understanding. Some people still think we are gay for each other including my crush who I asked out once or twice He is kind of like an asshole brother attitude, but he could be helpful I literally need to know or I won’t be able to forget this.See, that guy is a part of my imagination, so my brain altered the specific imagination, and imagined a guy who thinks he doesn't exist. By the explanation I got, my brain did that to have him stay here and avoid the conflict of him not being real and my brain acknowledging schizophrenia. Usually when an imaginary friend is acknowledged as imaginary they disappear. They were scared at the start, but overcame the fear eventually; in the case of a guy with bipolar, two days. For the girl I have a crush on, she is still scared of me. But if she forgets about both my mental disorders and her guilt of turning me down when I asked her out, she is still very nice to me fortunately. I wouldn’t be at all shocked to hear that that’s how the idea of ghosts and mediums got started Don't worry too much about that, we still act like a normal person, just occasionally talking to air. Also since Schizophrenia comes with difficulty in social life, chances are the people with schizophrenia will be the one guy who is always sitting in the corner in a party, or not in a party at allGet your head checked up, these kind of shit could be serious. But online friends who you never meet is quite common though. Think about what you are saying. Why would a guy you've talked to for years be just a figment of your imagination? I think you should get checked up my man.Yup. He comes and goes, intruding my life at will even after I acknowledged him as non existent. What the fuck is that placeOh shit, hide me. But really what is the purpose? To live in an imaginary world like a lucid dream? Sign me up, my life is quite rough. [deleted] Your brain is telling your brain to smile at your brain. Neat. Guy is still here, he acts like an asshole big brother with sociopathic traits. He got the condolences! Yeah, especially when schizophrenia comes with difficult in social life. He comes and go as will, just imagine if you are still in contact with your asshole big brother who has sociopathic traits. You don't live together anymore but very close and he has keys to your house. He's like a sociopathic asshole bike brother His appearance is basically an ideal me. He changes, but only because he wants to.I lost count how many people automatically assume I killed someone when I say I am a schizophrenic with psychopathic traits. When I was younger I experienced that pretty regularly. I thought I could read minds.[deleted]Fun fact: schizophrenia tends to express itself differently in different cultures. While in America, voices tend to be hostile, aggressive, and scary, in some parts of Africa, the voices are thought to be the voices of deceased ancestors, acting as a sort of guardian angel, often telling the person to do chores or something of that nature. Scientists don't know why exactly this difference exists, some attribute it to the fact that violence is a common part of Western culture that is often deemed acceptable, some believe it's because Western world view is very individual centric instead of group centric, and therefore the voices in the mind are seen as an intrusion and therefore scary. There are, however, some advocacy groups that believe in retraining your mind to control the voices; not necessarily get rid of them, but to no longer view them as a threat, to learn to live with them, and hopefully change them to be more positive (usually, the fear makes them worse, so just being able to identify and accept it is a big step). There's a [Ted Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/eleanor_longden_the_voices_in_my_head) from someone who learns how to gain more control over the voices and her experience with schizophrenia. Of course, this isn't necessarily a good substitute for medication and other forms of therapy, because schizophrenia causes more than just hallucinations: It can also cause depression, anxiety, catatonia (inability to control muscle movements), anhedonia (inability to feel pleasure), disorganized thoughts and speech, memory problems, cognitive dissonance, etc., so a combination of medication, therapy, support groups, and cognitive training exercises tends to be the most successful.Yep, I do.Yes. Before i used to hear my classmates from high school’s voices and sometimes celebrities’ voices. 

I became friends with the voices in my head and they even tell me they love me and laugh at my jokes. Nowadays they are mostly cute sounding girls. 

We have been so close that they nicknamed me Baby Boy. And i have learned to live with it and they became my imaginary friends. Lol. I got pretty mixed up with a misdiagnosis as a teen... See I never heard voices "outside" my head, but it turns out (a decade later we figured this out) I'm an Aspie so all my thoughts are frequently using the voices I've heard throughout my day, including TV, radio, in person, etc.

It's not something easy to explain... And as a teen I really botched it trying to get this through.  But basically they were my thoughts, and I knew they were, and I didn't hear them as "outside", but I had a lot of rapid thoughts, using the tone of voice of multiple characters, people, etc in a form of internal conversation.

Mind you, my memories were not merely photographic, but videographic... My favorite thing to do on the ride home was replay the day, and I could skip ahead, rewind, etc... It was so detailed that I could hear jokes told during 2nd hour on the ride home, verbatim... in their exact tone of voice.

I remember some days being bored af doing a math test that I watched an entire episode of The Flintstones in my head while completing the test... Got a 98% on the test to boot, and that was in 2nd grade... f'ing 30 years ago now... Still remember this shit.I've heard my own voice from when I was a child. (as an adult)I hear echoes. That's what I call them. To me they are indistinguishable from audio, they have direction and I will turn my head to hear better. I find myself quite often randomly hearing a line, a few words, a single word that I've heard before. These could be any time from my past like I'm just remembering something but I'm not actually trying to remember or recall that thing. It took me a really long time to figure out it was things I've already heard. As a child things are repeated all the time to you, so it really felt like I was being scolded, or told things like "use both hands" when I wasn't. Very often the words have nothing to do with what I am doing at the moment and I used to get mad about people not making sense. Like my dad is in the other room and I think he is telling me something...again...I would say, "I KNOW." And then he would actually be wondering who I was talking to.A friend I️ had in high school developed schizophrenia his junior year and he said that he would hear my voice a lot.I go on a mental illness/health chatroom and one of our former regulars (he's alive, but I never see him online anymore) used to talk a lot about hearing his neighbors say bad things about him through the apartment walls.

Hint: they weren't saying shit. Dude needed an adjustment with his meds or something.I hear crowds. I used to think I was reading the minds of the people around me (this started in elementary school).I hear three middle school aged girls who just bully the crap out of me. One I can pinpoint as this girl Nelly. Another might be her friend Anna. I don't know the third. Also once in a while a girl in my 8th grade class who was murdered. Sounds like she's begging for help. Currently healing over a breakup. Her voice haunts me every hour of every day. You don't need to have schizophrenia to hear voices. 😔This happens when I'm trying to sleep sometimes

iirc it's called a hypnagogic auditory hallucination and it's completely normalmy bro always heard his family talking bad about him even tho we were really talkin about how to help and it was hell gor 2 years until clozapine was what worked for himThese voices, is it like when you think you hear someone call your name and you turn and look?My guess are Mirror neuron dysfunction. When people see someone else do something or say something, your own brain repeats that internally, even if you don't physically make the same gestures. If you hear someone elses voice in your head and they are not around, I would suppose your mirror neurons are activating at the wrong time and with much stronger impact than average brain patterns develop at.

Seems like a basic inhibitory medicine could help, but just as likely behavioural training to question external stimuli and rely on internal resolution methods could help dull symptoms; its likely you've already done this to a point naturally but someone trained to help might make a big difference.

source: i am not a psychologist.The only voice I have heard that was someone I know is that of my first ex, who I'm still friends with. He was saying my name. I've heard him say other things too but I don't recall the content. All my usual voices are unique to their circumstances, never heard them elsewhere. The meanest voice I've experienced is my older sisters. Probably something to do with her treating me like shit growing upYeah, I hated it at first but kinda grown to like the fact they're not all random unknown voicesFor me it's almost like an immediate memory of hearing someone talk. It's never actually audible, but you know what they sounded like and it sounds/sounded realIt's audible but it's a different type of audible. I don't hear it in my ear, exactly, but it's not an intrusive thought. It's a separate voice.For me it's like having a radio on in the background on a low volume that you can't really hear but when they say something relevant you tune in for a sentence or two. Also even when its actually quiet it feels like you're sitting in a waiting room with someone. You know someone else is sitting right across from you but you don't want to acknowledge them and hope they don't start talking to you.They've done PET scans on schizophrenic people, and the auditory portions of the brain are active when they are hearing voices. I heard it like they were talking about me right behind me. As i was laying on my back, alone in my room.  Creepy as shit when it gets out of controlI get two: hearing “through my ears” where it seems to come in in the usual manner. Most often in public. And “in my head” which are Not always literal real time, but you “know” you Did hear it and what and who it was. Audible voice like someone speaking but there is noone there. Sometimes they have a mind of their own and say whatever they want. Auditory hallucinations actually activate the areas of the brain that process hearing. So it's like it is really audible to the person expereincing them.When it happened to me when I was little I could “hear” it like it was in my head. I was often startled. In my experience, it registers as an actual voice. If you've ever heard someone calling you from another room, it's literally indistinguishable from a hallucination.Apparently its common for deaf schizophrenics see disembodied hands signing to themWhen I heard voices, I heard it as clear as I hear any other voice (just like my visual hallucinations were as clear as any other thing I saw). Technically it's "in my head," but it sounds/looks as real as anything else. It just isn't *actually* real. (Although my visual ones were more a quick look that disappeared on second glance, so they were easier to figure out). That's what made it so difficult to decide it isn't real. I'm not schizophrenic though. I just had hallucinations for a short period of time. People with schizophrenia often hear "literal" voices. Their disease often also interferes with their ability to distinguish between "internal" and "external" stimuli, so many don't recognize the hallucinations as in their head until after diagnosis.

That said many also experience "delusions" which is what you would be referring to as a strong feeling or suspicion. "Intensely held beliefs not rooted in reality" can be a component of many different psychiatric diagnoses, and can range from realistic to entirely bizarre.God I need this answered. You put into words a question I didn't know how to formulate for years.You literally hear them. I am not a schizophrenic, but I had to withdrawal off of alcohol and had horrific audio hallucinations. You actually hear voices, animals, music, electronics clicking on, etc. 

When it first started happening I was annoyed because I thought the neighbors upstairs were vacuuming at 3am. That morphed into the Mario Bros. theme song, then into general music, then horrifying demon voices. I tried to plug my ears and could still hear it. 

Detox fixed the problem and now I'm sober so it's all good. But yeah, hearing shit is not cool. Don't drink too much kids. Not op but it can be either. Some people hear voices and some are paranoid.Generally speaking, the voices are not *in* your head. In fact, that's one of the things the interviewer considers in determining whether it's faked or not. It usually manifests as a disembodied voice.I myself literally hear voices, whispers, and music. Literal voices.I didn't realize I was the only person hearing them until later. I realized they were dicks before I realized they weren't real.I think people would be surprised how common it is. Like 1 in 100 people in the United States deals with it. Most people probably know at least one schizophrenic person and don't realize it.People in my head.Just like two men taking. Only difference between hallucinating and actually hearing is I have trouble telling where the sound is coming from.Actual voices. But I can sometimes feel the emotions of the voices even when they're not talking, if that makes sense.Different voices do different things. Some are negative, some are nice, and some don't interact with me directly.

Some of them specialize in different things. One guy is pretty good at math and another taught me accordion.Depends on the voice. Some are dicks and not worth listening to. Some are cool. There's a dude that helps me with math sometimes. I think it should be taken in a case-by-case basis. That can really help some people but some people will not benefit from more interaction.Depends on the voice. They don't always interact with me directly so sometimes it's like overhearing a conversation. Sometimes it's pretty clear.

Part of doing better is that I don't hear voices as often (I still hear things all the time but it'll be like traffic/animals/music/etc) and when I do they're typically more muted. Like if you butt dialed someone and they're trying to get your attention from your pocket. But they can range from faint whispers to screaming.They don't always say bad things! It can vary from person to person. I have good and bad voices. Some studies have shown that culture can shape it, too. [Here's an article.](https://news.stanford.edu/2014/07/16/voices-culture-luhrmann-071614/)It's an actual voice. I'm really good now at distinguishing hallucinations from reality so it's not as bad but kid me didn't realize it was a problem.Talk to a shrink! Even if they're just intrusive thoughts you'll benefit from learning to manage them.I don't. When I recognize I'm experiencing paranoia I take steps to start coping and getting rid of it no matter how mild it is.Don't be afraid to take care of the negatives! I was worried I would lose the perks if I treated the worse bits but being in a good state of mind has helped me so much with creativity. What kind of music do you do? I started school as a saxophone performance major but focus mostly on writing now.Different voices. Not my voice or anyone I know.My hallucinations have tells that make it so I can figure out what's real and what isn't. When I hear things I can't tell where the sound is coming from like I can with other things. It's like the world is in stereo but my hallucinations are in mono. Now that I know that I'm pretty good at differentiating between reality and not reality.

The hallucinations are audible voices, not just intrusive thoughts.Time, patience, good support system, and working with a qualified medical professional.Strangers' voices.Stranger's voices.Actual voices.Plenty of people experience that! You're not alone. Counseling can help quite a bit.Sometimes, yes. But not often.Haven't heard of it before now but it has LeVar Burton AND Rachael Leigh Cook so I'll for sure check it out.I don't think that's bad, no. But I do think you can get just as good of results by typing "kittens" into Google.Yes! With various ups and downs. I've had bad reactions to some medications in the past that made me skeptical but I've been on the same two medications for the last three or four years and its done wonders for me. Meeting regularly with a therapist is also a huge help.

I hope your mom opens herself up to receiving help. I had a very early onset of symptoms and don't really remember when I first started to hallucinate. I will say it's gotten quieter as I've gotten more of a handle on things.

Stress can definitely trigger things. So can sleep deprivation. If it's something that concerns you (especially if the voice gets mean) I would recommend talking to a doctor.I have one medication that I take daily and I also take Xanax as needed.

Outside of the social isolation, the voices never told me to do anything to myself or to other people. But the depression that accompanied the voices did lead to self-harm and suicidal ideation.Not the voice of anyone I know, but still just a normal voice. No accent or speech impediment or anything like that.I started hearing voices when I was a kid. Started treatment in high school and was diagnosed my first year of college.

I avoid drugs and alcohol. I'm related to a bunch of alcoholics and I'm allergic to weed but there's also a huge predisposition to addiction among schizophrenics and many drugs can bring out or worsen schizophrenia in people who have been diagnosed or have a family history.

I don't really remember a time before the voices to remember how it started, but I've been hallucinating since early elementary school.I'm in a really good place now where I don't feel held back but there are certainly a few years of my life I feel were lost to mental illness.Some of the people in my head have certain hobbies or talents that I can mooch off of. One guy is good at math and helps me out when I need it. Another guy really likes music and he'll teach me how to play instruments and write songs with me.Audible voices. I hear it just like you hear someone talking to you.

I've been dealing with PTSD (not related to schizophrenia) for the last few years and I can honestly say it's harder than anything else I've ever gone through. I hope you find peace.I've been hallucinating since I was a kid and started treatment in high school. Meds and therapy help a lot and I'm lucky to have a really solid support system.I thought they were real for several years.I don't think so.That's interesting! I've met Brandon but didn't know he had written anything about mental illness or I would have asked him about it. My wife's a pretty big fan of his work so we might have to read it together!I love A Beautiful Mind. I looked up to John Nash a lot when I was seeking treatment and was very sad when he passed away a few years ago.

Nice voices aren't exactly going out of their way to compliment me. But they're friendly. One guy helps me with math.I've added it to my queue!Nope! I write full-time now.(Not OP)- One big reason I really love Reddit is that we finally get a place to be able to ask all these honest, yet potentially rude and/or morbid questions and get thoughtful replies back more often than not. Or a simple "I don't want to talk about that." I've never seen anybody get mad about somebody asking a dark question. Besides all the time wasting, I do learn a lot here actually. Thank you Reddit.I thought 30 would be considered slightly high for men and about average for women, or is that not the case?  My uncle has it and didn't develop it until later in life so I've always been a little waryLike... his parents didn’t beat him for making them look “bad” and take away scary movies/video games?! I’m shook. [removed][removed]Honestly it's weirder hearing a 9 yo had enough sense to want to talk to someone when he felt wrong. Even adults dont do that. Well good parents are only interesting in situations like these so there's a lot fewer crazy stories that involve them, but bad parents are constantly creating crazy stories. I'd bet that crazy stories tend to get more upvotes and more discussion since they're more entertaining and it kinda makes you feel better about yourself since at least you're better than that, so we just hear about them more. 

Or maybe people with more fucked up senses of humor spend more time on reddit, so we think the bad parents are funnier. 

Or who the fuck knows I'm too high rnI dated my ex for 7 years who suffered with Bipolar Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder. It was absolutely horrible. But I found out soon after dating her, that her mother didn’t even BELIEVE that mental disorders exist because “they never had that when I was a kid”. “When I was a kid, and we were feeling sad, we just got over it”. “Why can’t you just eat a banana and go for a run to feel better?”.

I don’t blame her mother 100% for the severity of her condition, but I definitely give her a ton of the credit. She straight up denied anything was wrong for her entire life—despite seeing the cuts on her arms, and watching her life spiral out of control.

Fuck that psycho woman. She ruined so many things by not supporting her daughter./r/raisedbycaringparentsUnfortunately they work for EA.[deleted]I think the stories about bad parents get upvoted the most because the people of reddit are "insert emotion here" by horrible parenting. That's why we see more comments about that type of parenting.Well, Redditing is an overwhelmingly middle-class activity (or close to it, even if Redditors are trying to make it to payday), and so is using mental health services. I suspect the people who went without treatment for schizophrenia due to neglectful parents probably are in shitty living situations and a lot of them end up in prisons, trailer parks with no Internet, and out on the streets.Well most parents are actually very good parents.The parents who don’t do things wrong aren’t usually story materialSimple:

"My parent did something normal"


Reddit:  "meh."


"My parents were mean"

"Shit, poor guy, have an upvote"



This was an exception because the guy has to suffer with an unfortunate mental challenge. My parents are pretty good, all things considered but if I heard voices I'm 100% sure my mom would blame demons and just pray about it. Glad OP has top quality parents. Huh, what does that have to do with the post?[deleted]"well the voices did tell me I would be best off seeing a physician."And then they edited their post for some reason. Previous version [here](https://archive.fo/VjIZ9#selection-15459.0-15657.5). Higher IQ is associated with schizophrenia I'm pretty surePlease see a psychologist/psychiatrist soon. It can get worse untreated, and before you know it you've hurt someone. You can't take something like that back, so see someone soon. You won't regret it.Hey. I'm a former neuropsychologist. Do not be afraid to talk to a professional about this. It's their job to help. Please see one if not for yourself, for your friends and family 18 to 22 in males is were schizophrenia really sets in.Definitely worth getting checked out sooner rather than later. If it is something like schizophrenia - though there's lots of reasons people hear voices other than schizophrenia - the sooner it's treated often leads to better outcomes. Schizophrenia is unique to each person, and the voices can differ a lot. They are influenced by your social and cultural surroundings, and show differences based on [geographical location as well](https://news.stanford.edu/2014/07/16/voices-culture-luhrmann-071614/). In America the voices are generally very negative towards the person hearing them.I had no idea schizophrenia was genetic, or that the medical community even nailed down the reason or potential predisposition/s for it to occur. Please talk to someone now while it's not so serious. My SIL went undiagnosed for so long that she had a psychotic break and had to be hospitalised.Hi! Schizophrenic here. I'd highly recommend talking to a professional about this. Being told to harm yourself and isolate yourself socially is not good for your health and there are treatments and techniques available that can help. Please don't hesitate to PM me if you have any questions or need to talk to someone.Dude, get that checked, that's not the norm. 

And not to say that you're not "normal" or crazy or some bullshit, mental health gets stigmatized all to hell. Just to say there's probably a wire crossed in the brain somewhere there. Get it looked into and keep on keepin' on!Psychology grad student here. Go to see a psychiatrist or psychologist soon. Like, make an appointment now. You're at the age where this could *very* possibly get worse, especially if you go through anything stressful soon. Early intervention leads to better outcomes.Seems like pretty serious stuff... if your mind is playing tricks on you, you are defenseless! It is as interesting as it is scaryI had one tell me to cut off a finger. My sister walked in on me trying. I didn't do much harm but when I got home the next day all but the butter knives were gone. I didn't see them for almost a year. You really need to seek help asap. You're right around the age where it flares up badly and if you're not prepared you might not be able to keep it under control.Get help ASAP . These things will get worse without professional help and medicine Sounds like [the call of the void](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3st5ay/eli5_the_call_of_the_void/) on steroids. Scary stuff, especially with a family history of schizophrenia.I have not been diagnosed as schizophrenic, however have other neurological issues that are very similar symptoms.

When I was getting analyzed for schizophrenia the audio hallucinations ( I have audio, visual, olfactory hallucinations) were one thing that was a deciding factor.  As they explained to me there are two types of audio hallucinations:

Internalized - This is where you hear them in your head, similar to how you hear yourself when you are thinking of something.  

Externalized - This is where you have an audio hallucination but it seems to have an "external" source. Such as if it sounds like it is someone talking in another room. 

In my particular case they were externalized, so I passed that "test" (there are multiple) but it was one of the deciding factors.  

If however you are hearing voices that are prompting you to hurt yourself, then you should get checked by someone qualified soon.I have heard that those voices are often nice while you are young, when you grow up they might turn nasty. Please take care! Those voices should not disturb your life. Please seek help!Sometimes 'hearing' things like that isn't schizophrenia and is actually a form ocd. They're called 'intrusive thoughts' and can be pretty scary rather than the usual ocd thoughts people think of when they think of ocd.
Of course it's best to speak to a professional as they can tell you for sure, it's best to seek help asap as living with those kind of thoughts is horrible. Some of it is likely normal.  I once told myself "jump from this second floor balcony, it'll look cool if you jump from this distance.  It's only like 10 feet, so you'll be OK".  

But then I was like "nah", and didn't jump. 

Intrusive thoughts is what reddit calls it. Kinda sounds OCD like.  Definitely try to talk with one or two psych doctors before you settle on a diagnosis because the treatment is different.  I don't know the answer to this but I do know that they make goggles that you can wear so you can experience the auditory and visual hallucinations that individuals with schizophrenia experience. It's a great training tool for anyone working with schizophrenic patients. From my experience most don't try and physically interact with their hallucinations, mostly they just try to avoid or get away from them. The thing about schizophrenic hallucinations (at least visual, I don't  have auditory) is that we don't know they're not real until they go away. I have schizoaffective bipolar type. I often say something like "who's that?!" And my boyfriend says there's nothing or no one there. It usually comes out as something odd and garbled, like "who's that bug?!" My hallucinations appear as either half there or partially see through, or completely black. Think the lost souls in Spirited Away who got stuck in the spirit world. I've reached out to grab objects or swipe bugs off and they just disappear and I end up hitting myself or grabbing nothingI can only speak for myself. WHEN it’s happening, I Don’t know it’s “not real”. Same switch gets flicked as when you’re dreaming. No matter how OFF something is, you don’t (possibly can’t) even recognize the fact. (Meds Don’t make it go away. Just gives you the option of “roll to disbelieve illusion”). Everything combines. If I strike a pure hallucination, I Feel the strike and the “hallucination” responds as if you did strike a real creature/object. There’s no easy way to break out. Move things, smash things? 100%. After time or leaving and coming back (real physical moving) table is whole, wounds inflicted on myself are Gone. Objects? Right where I really left them. When I was younger (psych minor, specialized in Abnormal, and ironically (or appropriately) focused on Schizophrenia. Truly unique in so many ways: genetic, yet requires a trigger. Never manifest in any two people the same... ) Kinda Different 15 years after graduation after my break. Not so fascinating from the other side of the looking glass. (Ok it is, but with a Vested interest? Never could’ve imagined). Always figured “well I can just utilize Logic to understand which is and Isn’t happening. Done”. NOPE!
Example? The Razor Flies. Was renting a room in an old (2 decades right) friend’s house with another high school friend. Playing Fallout 3. And a fly lands on me. Instinctively brushed it away. And again, and again. (Very clean house, never saw so much as an errant roach IRL) look at the Flies after seeing how bold and aggressive they were. Slightly larger than a common housefly, smaller than a horsefly. Pure gloss black (not the natural iridescence of real ones) and the back is thickened almost to a jump and the chitin is drawn up to thorny forms jutting out of the top of the thorax. So when they land I swat them. And with the extra shell, don’t kill them, but the spikes punctured my palm. After several repetitions, both palms are dripping blood from the multiple puncture wounds. Never struck me (no pun intended) that these insects follow NO natural entomological pattern or basis). Both bro’s come in to see me standing in front of the sofa swinging wildly and screaming in panic. They knew my condition. And attempted (which Never works, but) telling me there Are no insects around. I hold up my hands, dripping blood and scream “then what caused this!” They appeared confused, which confused Me. They asked caused what? I go up and present my hands which were obviously severely injured and said “this! Why am I bleeding!?” Must’ve been a real Lady Macbeth moment. They tried to convince me there was nothing wrong with my hands, seemed unconvincing since I’m looking at and feeling blood dripping down toward my wrists and stinging like heck. Can’t always “talk someone down”. Gotta ride it out. Certain chemicals can break me out of episode, none a good routine solution. 

This is ON two anti-psychotics. Not like my life was great before my psychotic break. But now I love my entire life having to question and requestion Every detail, every minute, of every day. And coupled with Severe Narcolepsy, god help me as I move from brain only able to inflict AR (or remove objects and people from perception) to sleep where it gains full VR. And I’ve learned wield Occam’s Razor as a personal defense weapon. 

Any questions (respectful and legitimate) I’d be more than happy to answer, bearing in mind I can Only speak Truly from My Own experience and then from My perspective. Everybody’s different (disorders or no). 

Addendum: After the fact, looking back on what I Now know Never “Happened”...some of it’s pretty cool. Free fuel for sketchbook and canvas. Interesting experiences No One else will Ever have. WHILE it’s happening? If there’s a Hell after this, it’s got nothing on Schizophrenics. I have schizoaffective disorder with bipolar. That's what's frustrating. It seems SO real. As real as you standing in front of me real time having a conversation... I've heard music so loud it drowned out everything else. Imagine I'm standing right in front of you yelling and so is your best friend. You can smell his cologne, and my perfume. Then you're asked who you're speaking to, because there is no one there. 

I've had things pinch me, and could swear the mark showed up or even ache where the injury is. It's chilling. I'm unmedicated and every psychiatry and behavioral specialist wants me on meds. They say I'm like a small brush fire and it only gets worse with age. I don't agree. I do the best I can. Meds can make you worse too. Been through 7 at least, 3-4 at once a couple times. You ever hear the cure is worse than the disease? Feels that way sometimes. And now I know what a guinea pig feels like. I won't ever go back to seroquel or lithium, those drugs can f off in my life. Just commenting to follow... Super interesting.I'm also curious to know in4 answersMy Mom has said her hallucinations always feel and look real, its not like watching TV.[deleted]I would get them from my adderall, and from a distance they look incredibly real and scare the fuck out of me sometimes. And still do even if I stare right at them, but then when I would get up close to them they would turn back into whatever inanimate object they were. From my dad's experience: dad did not see/hear people who didn't  exist. Instead, he remembered false conversations, either between him and someone else, or "overheard". 

Of course, the movie "A beautiful mind" is based on a man who actually saw a lot of what the movie portrays.

Edit : this is, in fact, incorrect, Nash had auditory hallucinations, much like most schizophrenics.My Mom has said her hallucinations always feel and look real, its not like watching TV. She's on medication, but whenever she goes off them the hallucinations are more frequent.

Whenever she has tried to touch something in her hallucinations, it either a) triggers something in her & she realizes its a hallucination and not real or b) She 'feels' it and it disappears. 

This one time, the multi-coloured chinese-style dragon that she frequently hallucinates came right up to her. She reached out & felt its whiskers and its scales on its face before it vanished. I'm not schizophrenic, but I have had some experiences with mild psychosis, so I might be able to explain some things.

The closest I've come to a full-out hallucination is seeing what seemed to be a lynx (that is what my mind first thought of, but it was just vaguely catlike) in the corner of my eye. At first, it would go away when I tried to look at it, but the freaky thing is that it wouldn't just disappear, I would see it hide behind an object. As the hallucination intensified, I was able to watch it move and do whatever, it just acted like a cat. The weird part is that it looked nothing like a cat, it was just a collection of geometric patterns that looked vaguely catlike, but my brain immediately recognized it as a cat. Like, if I were able to reproduce what it looked like on paper and showed it to you, you'd think it were just a bunch of shapes.I read an excellent reply on reddit to a similar question a year or so ago.  The guy said the hallucinations look and act 100% real. So he's figured out a series of techniques to validate whether something is real or a hallucination. As I recall, afew of them included:  
* If it's something highly unlikely, like a giant purple monster in the room, look at how others are reacting. If they're behaving normally, it's a hallucination. If they ever start running and screaming, he'll assume it's real.   
* Wait it out. Bigfoot in the parking lot?  Just wait until it leaves.  
* Look in a mirror, or open the camera on his phone. Sometimes the hallucination won't be in the image. If it is there, there are usually obvious discrepancies, or the image is identical in direct vision and reflection, when the reflection should flip right/left, be at an angle, etc. Apparently his brain can't render the same image consistently in two different ways at the same time.   
* Ask a friend. When he trusts someone, he may share his diagnosis, and ask that they be a truth-verifier for him. So he can just ask, "Hey, do you see that dog too?" 
I'm not saying that it is, but if schizophrenia is anything like LSD, not only do you see things, but you lose your ability to determine if they logically should be there as well.

If you see a dragon, and simultaneously lose the ability to determine if a dragon would reasonably be there, then it becomes easy to believe that the dragon is real entity.

Full on hallucinations on LSD are rare, but the point stands about the distortion affect that still does occur.Real. Really real. I can't go to the movies near me or one restaurant near me because there's a ... I have no idea. A fixed hallucination? I still see them, even on meds. Its like these people are there, stuck in time. It's... Mildly concenrning.For me it’s like, as soon as you start to remember what’s actually going on and who’s there it all fades and you can’t remember anymore. It was real then and I’m aware it happened and I️ can never change the outcome. Same with speaking-when I’m speaking to someone I️ may be in the middle of a sentence asking a person something, then all of a sudden I’m in my room in the middle of the night with the lights off, standing and talking to “someone” who is no longer there..not sure if this reply will be seen or not, and I’m definitely not sure of any facts, but I️ haven’t read many other things like this and I️ couldn’t pass up the opportunity to share my experience. They are real. They generally don't cross senses (can be seen but not touched... etc.) But seem as real as anything else. I have had to learn mine and constantly reference the context in m in to determine how likely something I am hearing or seeing is real. I have auditory, visual, and tactile hallucinations, though rarely multiple at once, and only once has 1 sense reinforces another sense' s hallucination. The cameras thing someone else mentioned is my biggest problem now as I've developed methods to make my sensory hiccups inconsequential for day to day life for the most part. However I'm at a point where I can sustain longer relationships without it ever becoming apparent to the other person that I am ill. Only those I want to know know, unless I'm having more severe symptoms (upon which I generally get/stay home and focus on coping). To those who experience a hallucination, it is a sensory experience like any other... it is actually happening... it just may not make sense in context. Learning to recognize hallucinations is like getting really good at Where's Waldo. That has been my experienceI have a very large amount of visual and audio impressions, not hallucinations, that are not connected and seem to come from a very different sensory place in my experience.  The visual people are always shadowy 3d figures shambling around as if wearing really heavy clothes and drunk.  
The audio voices are a wide range of voice quality, gender, volume, clarity, and directed-at-me-or-not-ness, and some use my name...but they always originate from about 6 feet above and behind my head, no matter the room/outdoor dimentions at the time.  They never seem related, as in the shadows have never noticed me or tried to communicate with me.I had diplopia (double vision) and I have a friend with this type of schizophrenia who sees people. When I had double vision people would always ask "how do you know which ones real?" Honestly I just knew. One was always more faded and felt more in the peripheral. My friend had a similar answer. You just get used to it and learn how to tell the difference pretty easilyI’ve had visual hallucinations (not from schizophrenia... I think...), can’t tell if you wanted specificity.

Anyways, they manifest as a literal person I can reach out and touch. Primarily appear in dark rooms for me (which helps with hiding the whole not perfectly sharp image part), I’ve thought friends came over to visit before and said “hi, why are you here?” to them in empty rooms.A family member of mine has schizophrenia, she frequently sees this big multi-coloured chinese-dragon roaming around the house, moving through the walls. She said she tried to touch it because it looked so real. Have brain scans been done for this disorder? Are the proper areas of the brain stimulated? If so, it must be impossible to tell hallucination from reality. When you are hallucinating, can you tell?I have had visual hallucinations (not from schizophrenia) and once spent a couple of hours watching cartoons. Facedown on the carpet. 

That particular episode was caused by a couple of hits of weed and undiagnosed other neuro issues.  Other then that I see "shadows" or people looking in the windows.  Confused the hell out of me as the first time I was living on the second floor of a building with no way to the windows from outside.

[deleted]not creepy, just very real.  I can totally see how before a scientific understanding, super religious people would think it's the act of the devil or demonic possession or ghostsYeah. I always feel like just reading about it is going to make it happen to me for some reason.Sure, to normies.Musical hallucinations.  This topic is so interesting to me because there's not a lot of info about it.  I have heard songs in my head every day my entire life, in stressful times they can be obnoxious, playing just one refrain over and over.  Or I'll hear parts of people talking, like on a radio.  I know it's internal and there's no one actually talking, but it's so crisp clear what I hear that I wonder if it would be considered a hallucination?  When I first told someone about these voices, they said it sounded exhausting and as though my mind were making up for boredom, just filling in blanks.  But the problem is the voices will take over my brain and I can't think around them.  They hold me hostage and I can't do anything.  Is this something that happens to anyone else?It's white noise. Your brain tries to make sense of it, and this is what you get. It's not a hallucination.I get that when I don't wear my hearing aides for a while. My brain starts making shit up for me to hear. This sometimes happens to me when there is a fan going. I can hear music or a TV going, but when the fan is turned off, it all goes away.Look up musical ear syndrome?I feel like of all the schizophrenics, you have it the best. A nonstop rock concert is a lot better than your best friend slowly morphing into a monster and eating someone.First, I’m not schizophrenic, but I do have experience with musical hallucinations.

I changed anti-depressants and heard singing for about two weeks. At first it was a quartet, then eight voices, then more complex arrangements with other instruments. The arrangements started in the style of early Beethoven (but were, afaik, extemporaneous), but developed along the musical timeline along the way. Just before it stopped, I was hearing barbershop arrangements with cello (!) accompaniment.

For me, this wasn’t distant, it was pretty central, but it stopped when people were talking or I was listening to music. Otherwise it was 24/7.

Frankly, I miss it. It was pretty cool. Besides, I really wanted to see what my brain would do with jazz.This happens to me as well. I've also noticed it when a fan is on, especially blowing over my ears, or on the freeway. Oliver Sacks' books Hallucinations and Musicophilia discuss the phenomenon more.Same thing was happening to me in my old apartment if I left my PC running over night when I went to bed. My PC was humming but I heard rock music mixed in. Made me think I had left a music player on and the sound was coming from my headphones on my desk, or that my neighbour was listening to music, but it was neither. Happened every night and I could clearly make out a tune!  Eventually I just started turning my PC off for the night to save myself from questioning my sanity. Yeah I'm so confused by all these comments.It's because everyone's hallucinating lolI'm 90% sure that the image at the top of the article actually has nothing to do with the illusion. I can force myself to see the face in the video as concave, but not the still image. They never actually refer to the image in the article, just the video. Finally, I google imaged "hollow mask illusion," and the *only* place that image shows up is for the wired article; if it were an example of the illusion, I'd expect it to appear in a lot more places.It's also pretty rare to have visual hallucinations as a schizophrenic. Not saying OP is lying, but this would be a very atypical presentation of schizophrenia.[deleted]Rural Canada in the winter.I've got my life pretty much on track now. Forcing myself into social situations has really helped. But I still hear the music.Go for itIt's mostly real music, that I've heard before. Not necessarily full songs, or correct lyrics, or songs that I like. Just songs that I've heard and apparently can remember a bit. They kind of play on loop for awhile, mutating from one song to another.

Sometimes it's very vivid and I've even asked others what song is playing, and they just look at me confused. Other times, it's more obvious to me that it's in my head.

I don't really listen to music. Like, I hear it if it's on the radio in the car, or if it's playing on TV or something, but I don't seek it out.

If it's one of those times where it's really vivid, and I'm wearing headphones listening to a podcast or video, or something, then it's very overwhelming and I give up on whatever I was listening to. If I'm listening to something, but not with headphones, then it's uncomfortable but manageable.

If it's not so vivid, then headphones are fine, it's just kind of like background music I guess.
See: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/7cpmd8/comment/dptuva3This is actually really encouraging. My greatest fear is that my illness will continue rotting my brain until I'm no longer able to function as an individual. Hearing that things can go to such a dark place, and she is now able to function in the workforce and is stable is really good. Glad to hear things are going well, and thank you for sharing.My uncle was unmedicated for a long time and thought the FBI was after him. Constantly peeking out the blinds, whispering that they were watching and pointing to a hill in the distance where "they" were. Such a crazy scary disorder. Holy shit. I think I just realized my aunt is schizophrenic...This gives me a small amount of hope for some people I know going through similar times.Well, the part about the FBI spying through TVs isn’t all that wrong. Samsung smart TVs were recoding audio when turned off. FWIW the NSA can eavesdrop through samsung TVs.> the FBI was spying on her through the TV

https://www.wired.com/2017/02/smart-tv-spying-vizio-settlement/This kind of thing is what we were afraid of. Sorry for your aunt. Sounds horrible. Damn, that's roughHe almost divorced her a few years back but now is staying. I don't think he can handle how she would be without him. He handles it fairly well. She is way better now. But no where near normal. At her worst she said she would kill me in the most evil voice I have ever heard because I wouldn't go buy her cigarettes and bring them into the mental hospital. Sorry man, Its hard. This disease sounds like it has so many different outcomes. Lol, I didn't even see that. Now I have to leave it there!!!!!What exclamation point? I think you’re seeing things.Oh I'm aware. She is not allowed to see my children alone, not even for a min. She has had issues since I was about 14. One time throwing a hammer at me and my brother and hitting the microwave behind us, She would yell and scream when we were little. My friends would kind of know when we all needed to leave. My real dad died on a train somewhere. But of course is still alive and in the house. I’m pretty sure my mom has this too. I know she is diagnosed with 2 things and I always forget the other. Probably what it is. Here is paranoid schizophrenia and the other. This is true. This is the hardest thing for people to understand about my mom. She REALLY believes there is a FBI agent standing in the corner watching her. It’s as real as me sitting right in front of her talking to her. She is doing better now but there was some times where she was so scared. It’s so sad and heartbreaking. Literally can’t do anything to help. Yea there is so much more to my mom but I don't feel like sharing. But yea its so hard to explain it to others who know nothing about it. Yes on the nocturnal thing. My mom is always on the couch sleeping when I come over. No just her imaginary doctor who is her real doctor. The other one is a fake. So yea there is that we have to deal with everytime her meds run out of refills. That’s another thing. Fuck these people putting limits on refills for schizophrenia patients. Most of out problems would go away if that would change.......Dang. It’s so strange how almost everyone thinks there are people out to get them. On a side note. My mom also talked to the righteous brothers and said their new album is coming out soon and she helped write it when she was 13. I showed her that one of them died a long time ago and she said you can’t believe everything you read online. Lol. Well that is somewhat true. Yea not going to happen. I don’t think that would be right. No I don’t think so. I think I’m probably already saying too much online. That recording (audio) will stay with me. Sorry. I’m sure you understand. I know right. Soooooo glad it isn’t Trump. Thats' kind of what it was. I've always been a rather anxious person. The source of my anxiety shifted from what could be explained, to what couldn't, however. 

"Oh man, I'm so fucking awkward I hate this."

to

"They know. They know your thoughts. They're all in this together and they're against you. You're going to hurt them somehow and they are watching you. You can hurt them with your thoughts. You are evil, and they know you're evil. They see you for the villain you really are. Everything they do has an ulterior motive. Their casual glances, the smiles...They know, and it's only a matter of time..." - I'd project this on to people I'd see daily.many of these anxiety disorders and related mental illnesses have a lot of overlapping symptoms, for instance really bad anxiety can lead to a manic state including hallucinations. if you've struggled with mental illness in any form, chances are you're familiar with a wide range of symptoms.I have all of these symptoms when I get anxiety attacks (which seem to happen sporadically and for a duration of a few weeks at a time). I'm really paranoid that people hate me or *secretly* know embarrassing things about me. I always see someone standing behind my car when I'm backing up at night and hit the brakes only to find out that no one's really there. I can't seem to remember anything at all and will sometimes miss appointments. 
However, I'm sure it's just anxiety and not schizophrenia because these things appear more as just feelings or illusions rather than things I can stare right at or listen to. How old were you when this started happening? I've had paranoid delusions for most of my life and have a spotty memory. I've worried that maybe it could get worse, but it's been at the same level for so long I've just accepted it as part of who I am.Also have some of the memory and cognition problems, and I'm looking to be assessed for ADHD. It can present in a lot of different ways. Might be worth looking into.A lot of it sounds like my type of OCD too. Amazing how when mental disorders get severe enough they all start to resemble each other more. 20, around springtime of...I wanna say 2015. I am now 22.

It was a gradual progression I guess. I don't really have anything to measure it by. I just started being less and less in touch with reality as time went on and stressors increased. By December of 2015 and well into 2016, I was starting to see things and hear things that weren't there. During 2016 things started getting weirder for me. Suddenly my thoughts had powers (so I need to think about all the right stuff). I started gradually giving in to the idea that I could effect the world around me, and that people *knew.* Stopped sleeping, lost a lot of weight...It wasn't fun. Got the cops called on me once because I had decided to seek refuge in an empty building and was apparently "threatening" the people who were in it.

Worst it ever got the Summer of 2016. I had no job, no friends, nobody to talk to but a therapist, was riding trains back and forth to the city all day, and was on a cycle of meds that weren't treating me right (SSRIs and psychosis are usually a bad combo). I'd run out of the house without a shirt or shoes sometimes, and wander around for hours. At one point that summer I put my head through a wall in my house.

Finding the right antipsychotic was tough, but I'm glad I did. Hey, thanks man! I actually don't even take meds anymore, and I've been doing well. A lot of self-care, like sleeping, eating, socializing, and being productive has been helpful in that regard.

Frankly I just think it was an extended episode and not a chronic condition, but that's what it says on my diagnosis (along with other things)I guess it depends on your relationship with him, and the severity of his condition. It sounds cliche as hell, but just make sure that he doesn't feel like he has nobody to turn to (but don't make it just you he can go to).

If you want to support and help him, find a way to show that he is not fighting this by himself, nor is he hopeless. Become a part of his network of support. This should include friends, family, doctors, therapists and other specialists. 

The biggest thing that helped me was that even when I was acting odd and doing strange stuff, nobody was ever angry with me. Doctors and therapists presented me with solutions (or coping mechanisms) and my parents just told me that it wouldn't be this bad forever. It made me want to be better for not only myself, but for them as well.

I can try.

It was people, shapes and figures made out of shadows. When it first started, I thought I "just wanted to see things. " So I'd always feel like I saw little animals in my peripherals, watching me, and I'd look and see nothing there, but as time went on, I found myself taking second glances at things because I was constantly going "holy fuck did I *just* see that?"

It was like they were creeping in on me. I was doing this all the time in fact, just double checking to make sure that nothing was actually there.

So in my everyday life (ESPECIALLY when I didn't sleep) I'd start seeing indistinct "people" made out of shadows who weren't there. Waiting under porches, in the corner of my room, in coffee shops and libraries, standing in classrooms, pressed against walls...always watching me. When they became more robust, they started moving around a bit more. Little hands, sometimes walking, sometimes just following me with their heads. Then they started lunging at me, if that makes sense. One time I was out running, and just before I got into a tunnel, I saw one coming at me in a dead sprint. I fell flat on my ass and started screaming. The woman who was running behind me flipped out as well, probably because of what she just saw me do.I've been seeing therapists and specialists since I was in grade school, so having that background of support and introspection was instrumental. But what *really* put me on the right path was getting put on two different antipsychotics at the same time. Awful side effects, but positives I wouldn't trade for the world. Do you have health insurance ? It’s usually covered, but a challenge to find a doctor who is available and takes it. So it’s best to start before you urgently need it. If you don’t have insurance and are in us go to healthcare.gov this month and sign up and at your age you will prob qualify for Medicaid.

If you are at college then your school might also have some mental health professionals on staff for students.My advice to you is to start working toward the solution. Tell your family. Book an appointment with an expert. I’m not saying jump on meds, but from what I know, antipsychotics, when used during the Prodromal (early) stage of Schizophrenia, can stop the disorder from progressing all together. Just be as absolutely transparent about your fears as you can.

If there is a psychiatrist or psychologist lurking, please feel free to correct me. I am very sorry for to hear that. I am so grateful that I have not declined to that level.I'm just telling you guys what I have to tell my therapists and what my psychiatrist has in his files on me.I can attest to this, and want you to know that right now it sucks, and it's not going to be fun, but you *will* get better. It's not the end of the world until you let it be. Can you imagine how much stronger you're going to be once you deal with this?

I don't know if this kind of music is your thing, but when I was going through the worst of it, this album really resonated with me. It's a concept album about a writer who is slowly losing his sanity and trying to cope or make sense of it. In a lot of ways, this album described exactly how I felt, and maybe it'll help you too.

[La Dispute - Wildlife](https://youtu.be/LvqNmyJPTyk)Ha, that's what it felt like to me too. Only as an adult. There were times that I didn't drive because of it. I was scared it'd happen as I was driving and I'd hurt someone.Err. Yes. Don't go in seeking a diagnosis, but bring up some concerns. It's not impossible that you're just a forgetful person with a wild imagination.

I don't know how professionals decide when something becomes a clinical diagnosis, but my definition is when it starts to impede every day functioning or causes you consistent distress.Small gaps, luckily. But when you're developing a psychotic condition, you start to get worried that you're either going to lose yourself entirely, or things are "not as they appear" all the time. Generally leads to mistrust of your reality testing methods.Why do you type eye instead of I?I don't know. I'm not a professional in this realm. I can tell you though: Smoking weed is extremely bad if you have psychosis. Nobody should if you believe you are experiencing psychotic symptoms. It will only make it worse.

As for your fear, I would just suggest that you really do seek help, because treatment is available, and it CAN stop things from progressing even further if that's where they're headed. Weigh your outcomes of seeking treatment vs. now seeking treatment. It makes more sense to tell someone than to let something like this frighten you.

Again, I'm not a professional, but you have EVERYTHING to gain from at least speaking to a therapist or psychologist. Best of luck!I'm not a doctor but if everything else in your life (good sleep, healthy eating) is stable and your mental health doesn't seem to match up then stop doing drugs (if you do them) and tell a doctor everything. They're not out to get you, they dedicated their lives to help people.Oh i know it was psychosis. That was only part of it but I still have symptoms that lasted long after my treatment.  It's basically come down to managing my stress or else they come up again. So in a way...it's ongoing...I can't remember. I've moved since then and the only records i brought with me are what i was taking during my treatment. Risperodone or somethinf like that and a couple other things. Did you have a similar experience with that medication you mentioned? You should probably go and see a psychiatrist to get a second opinion. Might not even be schizophrenia, but the lights and paranoia warrant a second opinion just to be on the safe side. Hey so anti anxiety medications cause mydriasis and your pupils enlarge, making lights very bright. Normally this only happens a little bit, but you may have either taken too much medication or your body may be more sensitive to it. 

Hope that helps explain something for you!It can be if it's on a larger scale. When it becomes an obsession or you believe you have some special power or abilities. Look up delusions of grandeur. It's like when people think they're the next Jesus. Another one that used to (and very occasionally still) get that feeling.  With me with was either my tongue or my hands that felt huge.  Always when laying down in bed for the night (never during the day).  Just about every night as a pre-teen (I guess it could also have happened earlier, but cannot remember).  Stopped when I reached my teens.

Started again a few years ago (late 30ies), but it's very rare the feeling comes... maybe 3-4 times a year?  Not keeping count, just no it can be months between.  Again, when laying in bed tryin to fall asleep.

Very strange feeling.  I can feel my tongue (and/or hands) being enormous, but know very well they're perfectly normal size.  Apart from weird, I guess it also feels a little conflicting.  :)What was the name of your friends baby/alter ego?That definitely sounds interesting, I'll check it out!I wasn't diagnosed with schizotypal until I was 19. The diagnose they gave me at 12 was "long-lasting depressive episode". Also, I'm in europe, and ICD-10 classifies it as a clinical disorder rather than a personality disorder so I doubt my age mattered.

I've always been told that I'm in high risk of schizophrenia, but I've never actually had a full-on psychotic episode and I guess that's what actually differentiates it? I'm mostly just living kind of on the edge of it which is why it's so important that I keep an eye on my symptoms. [removed]I believe she's done a Ted talk as well!!Not schizophrenia, but a similarly fascinating and uplifting memoir of mental illness (bipolar disorder) is An Unquiet Mind by Kay Redfield-Jamison>It's very inspiring

Will it make me sad? I don't have schizophrenia but I have depression and if the message is "people with schizophrenia can achieve so much cool stuff" and ill never amount to anything it'll just make me more depressed again. Wonderful sense of humor I have an uneasy feeling it wasn't intended as a joke. Thank you for the kind words, it helps a bit :) [removed]https://youtu.be/igKZhwDOLac

Fates of NationsI know exactly what you mean. Some of these posts are hitting a little too close to home but I know I would be a very mild case since I'm functioning. I recently had an episode though that is making me go back and look at a lot of "quirks" I've had during my life that I just shrugged off as "normal" for me. https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/7cpmd8/serious_people_that_have_been_diagnosed_with/dpsv4vd/?st=ja31g300&sh=38e34541Licensed Clinical Social Worker https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/7cpmd8/serious_people_that_have_been_diagnosed_with/dpsv4vd/?st=ja31g300&sh=38e34541[deleted][deleted]Or maybe she is imaginary. I don't think doctors and therapists would overlook the existence of a restraining order, especially considering that the event which lead to the schizophrenia diagnosis is the same which supposedly resulted in a restraining order being issued. That guy might be a legitimate schizophrenic and it is spilling over into his reddit comments.[deleted]The issue appears to be that the single conversation wasn't real, not that the girl wasn't real.Could she actually speak Russian? I'm sorry about that. I have heard of schizophrenics staring off and seeming comatose for long periods of time, as far as I know the longest this has happened to me was when I was staring out of my window for an hour.Catatonia is the name of that side affect. It's often caused by antipsychotic medications. Lol, you think that's bad imagine what the doctors thought when you told them your reflection was moving even though you weren't.Yea, I read a ton of these replies and they send shivers down my spine. Can't even show in the movies how absolutely bone chilling these few sentences are from each person affected. I hope they all get better soon. To them it's their reality how can we blame them? It's real to them. Thank God we have medicine... let's just hope it's actually accessible. Never heard of this disorder until the thread. I've been diagnosed with depression and bipolar before and I'm on medication while my mom shows lots of signs of schizophrenia. She won't go to a psychiatrist because she goes to church a lot. Her art is absolutely wild...modern medicine hasn't explained or solved it yet. The difference between the terms "poor mental health" and "possession" isn't so clear as we would like to think.Yea it's a fine line with schizophrenics and taking medication. We know it makes a better, but it almost always comes with a price, so you may have good mental health, but you feel depressed because you can't find any joy in anything, or you feel emotionless all the time. Trauma can cause psychosis and psychotic breaks which I suppose could develop into schizophrenia. I wasn't sure for a long time whether my schizophrenia wasn't actually due to the abusive relationship I was in, seeing as how literally no one else in my family has it.Yea it is.Um...not really. I was with a steady partner for three plus years from 16 to 19 and sex was amazing. But I don't think that was because of the schizophrenia, I think that was because he knew what he was doing and it was enjoyable. I was never like slutty or anything, I dressed slutty at times, in corsets and goth mini skirts, that type of thing, but I didn't act the part if you wanna phrase it like that. I've never really been a super sexual person, in fact on the last antipsychotic while single I masturbated twice the whole year, I had no appetite for sex. Now that I'm off that particular meds, my sex level still seems to be below normal in that I only get horny around the time for my cycle, but that's common so nothing unusual here.I don’t usually talk to people on here, but I’m glad you’re finally getting the attention you need for your eating disorder. My mental illness is more visible only because I self mutilate, so no one really doubts when I say I want to die, lol. But at the same time I have horrible reproductive issues and pain and it’s harder for people to see pain that’s not visible like my cuts, you know? But all in all I’m very happy for you, and I hope your situation is better. I don’t know about xamcali, but apparently schizophrenics have a higher instance of irritable bowel syndrome. My stomach was a mess from the anxiety I felt. as a  hypochondriac woman this thread was a terrible idea.33 year old male here who has seriously been out on a witch hunt for why I don't feel good. There are plenty of reasons, but doctors seem to think it's sleep deprivation and anxiety for me. I've been told that if I was scziphirenic I would have been diagnosed already. I have just only now after reading these posts start to realize that I should trust the doctors... I have been going through hell in my own mind the past two years and this am has now helped relieve some of that anxiety. I'm honestly not sure, and things were getting pretty dicey by the end there. I was very suspicious of everyone for quite a while, and had this idea that I needed to keep my knowledge of "the plot" under wraps for the most part, so that probably helped a lot in terms of appearing normal (enough to keep my job, anyway) at work. I don't watch Family Guy very often and don't remember a part like that from it, but your theory made me laugh :)i remember reading about that. awful, awful situation.That's awesome! I was actually working in the mental health field as well, ironically enough, up until I recently had to quit my job. 

For the most part, I think, people just want to be heard. Take the time to listen to what they're saying and try not to invalidate it (like if someone says something that seems utterly crazy to you, you could respond with "I'm not experiencing that the same way" or "I understand that you heard that just now, but I didn't" rather than "that isn't real"). 

I'd also recommend doing some reading around the negatives of psychiatric medications, if you haven't already. This is something I struggle with a lot as someone who is "expected" by most people to take antipsychotics as part of my daily routine. If nothing else, I think it's important to have both sides of the story. Peter Breggin and Robert Whitaker have some great books on the subject.I had a little jolt of anxiety when reading that Exploding head syndrome. I went through a period where I'd have sleep paralysis a couple times a month and once during this period while I was falling asleep I heard the loudest boom I'd ever heard and jolted awake. I looked over at my sleeping girlfriend and decided it was in my head so I immediately googled it and felt better.I've dealt with sleep paralysis and hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations for the past 24 years. It's scary when it happens, but it's nothing psychiatric. If anything, it could be indicative of a sleep disorder, but that's about it. Yeah, it's fairly common.  A week or two ago, one got me all the way out of bed because I was almost asleep and thought I heard my son crying and calling for me.  Went all the way to his room and made sure he was asleep and safe.  
Oh shit so it has a name. Sometimes when I’m dozing off in a boring class or soemthing I hear heavy metal music.[deleted]I hear a large crowd clapping, like I'm in a stadium. One time I heard a woman talking to me. Just when waking up.I needed this! I was almost getting worried about hearing voices right before sleep.If I concentrate on what I'm hearing as I go to sleep with nothing in the background I get all kinds of strange noises and potentially snippets of voices. Its like someone is spinning an old timey radio dial, and from what I've heard its fairly common. 

I have a sleep disorder similar to narcolepsy, and I've had very vivid auditory hypnogagic and hypnopompic hallucinations on a number of occasions. I'm used to them now, but when you're alone in the house and you wake up after hearing your voice bring screamed or hearing pounding on your door, it's very disconcerting.Classic redditWhat have you been noticing?I think we are all a little funny . With family history in the mix we definitely are fine tuned a bit more differently. Being constantly aware is a huge thing I find keeping me sane. In fact I have no fears in this world other than getting schizophrenia ....first time I have written /said that. You should definitely see someone now. Not because “oh my god panic,” but because you’ll either

A) find out it’s nothing and gain peace of mind, or

B) get early help and go on to continue leading a normal, healthy life. =)


I was under heavy stress for a long time and my OCD/intrusive thoughts started to become something more severe. Fortunately, the voices I heard were friendly and loving, not hostile (a woman humming/singing, a man whistling, both felt like friends reaching out from somewhere ‘beyond.’) They faded as my stress decreased and as I forced myself to stop panicking over them.

It could be just that you’re stressed and psyching yourself out like I was. Or, it could be more intense than that. Either way, talk to a professional! That’s what they’re there for.How old are you?My mom had schizophrenia too. I was so terrified of getting it, that I constantly doubted reality and was frequently seeking confirmation about things from friends. It was not psychosis, but the anxiety that drove me nuts. Now that I'm in my 30s, I think I'm almost clear, so I'm not as anxious about it. Hope that helps you understand yourself.How old are you? Have you been a bit low lately?The other night, I woke up hearing a loud boom/crash.  I just sat up in my bed freaked the hell out, convince that someone was there about to kill me, then eventually remembered I have exploding head syndrome, what I heard wasn't real,  and fell back to sleep.  

The next morning, I wake up again, and go to the bathroom.  

The freaking shower rod, which holds my curtain and various shower things, collapsed onto the toilet and the floor, and knocked a bunch of shit over.Holy shit I love Reddit. I've had these my entire life and it always makes me panic because one time I read about a boy who had a spider in his ear and he described it as sounding like there were explosions in his ears! I'M SO GLAD IT'S A SYNDROME AND NOT SPIDERS 😭😭😭😭I've had those. Sounds like every pot in the kitchen just came crashing out of the cabinets and onto the floor. I've learned now, when I hear a loud noise in the night, first thing I do is look at my cats. If they're just dozing away next to me, all chill, I know it's nothing.I had these and they weirded me out for awhile. No when I get them I'm like cool! I'm experiencing a strange auditory phenomenon! Oddly enough after I learned what they were they started occurring more frequently. The name is so apt. It really does sound like an explosion that has your brain at the epicenter. Omg. I thought my house was haunted. Thank you. I will read more on this!!!Oh my god thank you for posting this. I’ve been thinking I’ve been having seizures for years and no doctor has ever had any other explanation other than “you’re fine.”Oh wow !!! I’ve only ever had this once; I woke up at like 6am to the sound of an explosion and I was really freaked out looking out my window for some sort of indicator and there was nothing at all. No one else heard it either. Cooooool brain stuff !Oh! THAT'S the thing that happens to me when I'm about to fall asleep. Overly dramatic name though lolThat happened to me once, about 18 years ago.

I was sound asleep, and I woke up to the noise of an explosion. I was CERTAIN that there had been one. I even got dressed and went outside, looking up and down the street for the source. I couldn't understand why no one else was outside, and there weren't any sirens or anything. 

I ultimately went back to bed, but when I woke up in the morning, I scoured the newspapers for a report, since it was so loud it had to have made the news, right? Nope.

I talked to a couple of neighbors, but apparently I'm the only one who heard anything.

It wasn't until just a few years ago that I learned of Exploding Head Syndrome and realized that's exactly what had happened. I experienced something like this for several weeks when i was 18 or 19...I had recently started doing ecstasy fairly regularly at the time (was a lot of fun while it lasted but it was having noticible effects on my body including non stop shaking sometimes and this exploding head syndrome)

Everytime it happened, I was trying to fall asleep and the room was completely silent. I remember thinking things like "damn, it would be pretty stupid if I were to think of the loudest, most annoying sound right now, and just keep thinking about it non stop" and it would happen. Like hundreds of cymbols crashing just non stop getting louder and louder until I would have to sit up and shake it out of my head. I stopped doing ecstasy pretty quickly after that and it toned all the way down to the point I haven't experienced it in 10+ years now.Weird, I have always experienced something like this but it's more like a half-dreamed thing... I know it isn't real immediate after jolting back to alertness, and it always happens as I'm just initially falling asleep. However I don't have any strong memory of sounds associated with it most of the time (barring a few exceptions, like a trumpet blast, etc.) 

Mine usually seem to involve me thinking I'm being hit in the face with an object, or falling down (sometimes I'll think I've fallen off the side of the bed), or that I'm drowning, or other visual and tactile sensations. I end up jolting back into being awake when it happens, heart racing, sometimes sweaty.

It never happens in the middle of the night that I'm aware of, just while initially falling asleep.

Based on that wiki page though, what I experience doesn't seem to quite fit that diagnosis...I mean like dreaming as Trump himself. Sometimes I'm an entirely different person with an entirely different life. That's really cool how your point of view jumps around though!I feel you, my Dad went batshit a few years ago and my brother and I always wonder if it will hit us. Both of us have our father's rage and short fuse. We aren't exactly sure what disorder he has because he has refused treatment (multiple times), and him being in and out of jail (multiple times) has given him the uncanny gift of knowing how to work the system. His list of crazy involves driving his truck through a field of  Artichokes ($15000 in damage), trying to steal a giant cross from a local Indian Casino/Reservation, allowing homeless people to stay in his yard by planting a "sanctuary" flag in front of his house (approximately 40 people over 6 weeks), not showering/wiping (for weeks on end), and lastly trying to come to my radio gig to fist fight me for talking about the Artichoke thing on air. 
 
I have started taking Wellbutrin for my anger/dread and has seem to curbed my outbursts. (traffic/annoyances/basic life) But, I am afraid that there will be one day that I decide to drive my car into an Artichoke field because "they" would want me to.My dreams are insanely long and sometimes they continue over the course of a couple weeks. I really enjoy it! Well most of the time. Sometimes it's terrible, like last night. I wrote a whole web application. It's like my sleep got robbed from meLong, extremely vivid, very tiring... exactly how I would describe my dreams as well.sounds like sleep paralysis and/or hypnagogic hallucinations imo. Used to get them as a young teen.I do suspect I need to sort out my sleep hygiene. Although I'm practically always tired despite getting around 8 hours of sleep daily, I wouldn't call it excessive daytime sleepiness. My memory is poor but I figured that was just a part of my absent-minded personality. Thanks for sharing your experience! I'm glad your partner compelled you to go to the doctor. :-)I also have extremely confused waking up thoughts, just like those. Super, super bizarre stuff. That's what scares me too. I'm a female in my late 20s. I am scared to turn into what one of my parents was and put my loved ones through that. Considering that weed can cause symptoms of psychosis to intensify or trigger their start, I wouldn't suggest smoking a lot of weed if you're already concerned you might be showing symptoms of schizophrenia.What would be past the age when it presents itself?That was our resident physician, /u/eattheturkey No, I’ve had other symptoms, but I didn’t link them to psychosis. Just assumed it was from sleep deprivation. There was no rational logic behind wanting to kill him.Yes, married, buying a house, dog owner, and murder-freeNormally, I’d agree. He’s a foot taller than me. But he has a serotonin issue that makes him nearly impossible to wake up. I think I had to punch him in the dick to make him leave.[removed][removed][removed][removed]I'll respond soon. Just eating breakfast now. I do not have the notebook anymore. Got rid of that a long time ago. I would have never been able to decrypt it because what I wrote was nonsense. 

I've had mental illness (depression) since middle school and have been in therapy since upper elementary school.  Symptomology changed over the years but I've always had a gift of insight into my symptoms which has been helpful in my recovery. My official Dx is [schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type;](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000930.htm) and [dissociative disorder, nos; (look at fugues and depersonalization)](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dissociative-disorders/symptoms-causes/syc-20355215?p=1), and [conversion disorder (it's not what it sounds like!)](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000954.htm)

I was a sophomore in chemistry class at my local community college when I was scribbling down furiously in my notebook. Class ended. Professor didn't say anything to me, but from the outside, I bet I looked "off."  The building's hallways had floor-to-wall windows on both sides. I thought that there were shadow people and started screaming at them. Students had cleared away from me, but a nursing student came up to me and asked if I was okay. I didn't respond. Then campus police (armed, sworn police officers) and the school psychologist showed up and started talking to me. I was already seeing the psychologist once a week so she knew me well and the campus police were very calm and didn't make me feel scared or worse.  I've always felt better among authority figures. Helps me feel safe.

We walked over to the psychologist's office, and she called my mom. The psychologist was hesitant in letting my mom pick me up as opposed to me taking an ambulance directly from school to the local "regular" hospital's psychiatric emergency room. When my mom showed up, I got into the car, and we drove back home. The drive was only twenty minutes away from home. When we got home, we called my psychiatrist, told her what happened, and I got an appointment with her the next day. I'd been seeing this psychiatrist since I was 12 and I think I was 22 when this happened. I never did wind up going to the hospital ("regular" nor psychiatric). I just went and got prescribed an atypical antipsychotic (Saphris in black cherry!) and a benzodiazepine (Klonopin).  I didn't need to go to the hospital that time because I've never been a danger to myself or others and we wanted to give the meds a try. They worked, and I haven't had hallucinations since then and I didn't need to go to the hospital.

 I would then take a break from school for two-ish years attending a partial care program for young adults that was very helpful. Then at 24, I went to finish my senior year at a medium-sized public university, but I went into fugue states and lost time (sometimes as long a period as three days. My professors were incredibly accommodating and let me takes quizzes and tests from my on-campus apartment. But after that first semester, I had to take medical leave because I couldn't keep going with that dissociative disorder. But I did get pretty good grades that semester. 

I took a year off again, attending of different program called intensive outpatient. I found this program to be more useful. So when I thought I was ready, I went for my second try of senior year. The first two months of Autumn, I was doing pretty well. But I grew increasingly worried about the presidential election, but everyone assured me that Trump wouldn't win and everything would be alright. The day after election day was one of the worst days of my life. I was crying and sobbing, both from fears that any person without mental illness would have and some beliefs I got carried away with, such as if they want to go after the Muslims, the Jews will be next! (and I happen to be Jewish). I was terrified that I would lose my Medicare, Medicaid, and Childhood Disability Survivor benefits. I couldn't concentrate in class. I hadn't had any hallucinations since 2012 but my fear of Trump was obsessive so on my facebook account, I unfollowed every newsources and blog from my news feed because I did not want to see do with politics. Mentions of Trump and related politics triggered me (lol) but I was certainly not the PC police. My view is that the internet is NOT a safe space. Social media is not a safe space. You want a safe space? Go to a designated page or site, like r/schizophrenia or themighty.com and tons of other places.  Sorry for the tangent but it just pisses me off.  College classrooms, too. That being said, I can understand content warnings/trigger warnings because it gives people a fair chance to not sit through something that could be traumatizing. Still, even to this day I can't say "triggered" without a grin because [I can't help but picture this.](https://imgur.com/a/MANa3) 

The school psychologist I saw grew concerned because I would be awake for up to 5 days at a time (but no grandiosity or dangerous behavior). She was concerned that the hypomania would only get worse and turn into mania. So I went to an IOP program near my school, and that was helpful, even though I had to miss some classes a week. My professors were understanding and didn't mind as long as I handed in my work.

Sorry for the soliloquy. It feels good to get this stuff off my chest. What am I doing currently? I'm 26 and finishing up schoolwork from the previous academic year. I still attend an IOP program. My professors gave me extra time to complete the work. School would've been impossible for me if I did not have disability accommodations.

 I already walked the stage in Spring 2017, but I officially will graduate with my Bachelors in December 2017. Then I'm going to apply to grad school.

Right now, my most significant issue is anxiety. But hopefully, it'll diminish once I finish my schoolwork.

Thanks for listening.[removed][removed]Talk to someone else, because this sounds really familiar. If the psychiatrist brushed it off, then he's not worth your time. There's a lot of bad therapists/psychiatrists out there, but when you find the right one it's worth the time.Yeah, pediatric mental illness is a little trickier to diagnose than adult disorders, but in retrospect, I think I'd be able to say that I suffered Malease/Depression since pre-school.


My teachers, and friends always made me feel like I was one of the top-tier brightest students in my peer group, and although I should have taken that as a compliment at the time, instead I felt very isolated, abnormal, and alien since early childhood.


I constantly over thought this whole "being human" thing, and was quite envious of my peers that didn't seem to be as confused by "being human" as I was.


[Side notes: No one likes a very serious 8 year old that likes to only dress in black.]


So I focused on science, and art instead of building normal peer relationships. I felt very alone.


I couldn't *hide* my "difference", and had a really hard time dealing with the fact that other kids could just normally "human", but I couldn't, or had to try really hard to accomplish it, and even then I couldn't quite pull it off. (possible aspergers)


I wanted nothing more than to just be like one of the "normal" kids, and it gave me great anxiety, but I found consolation in my talents, and I was talented.


At 11 I had my first psychotic break from reality. I was convinced that my parents were actors, and I was about to start knocking holes in the walls looking for the cameras before I managed to talk myself out of the delusion.


More to your point, there was one specific instance that caused me to ask for therapy...


I was on the playground with another child, and he made me angry/frustrated, and I wanted to hurt him, **But**, when I searched my consciousness, I couldn't find any logical reason for this feeling (I've always been into logic), and that troubled me because I've never been a violent person, and this kid hadn't done anything to me, but I still felt this animosity towards him, and I could reason that it didn't make sense, so I asked to go to therapy.


I knew about therapy at that age because my parents have always been very open, and honest with me, and my mother was going to therapy to help her deal with my emotionally neglectful alcoholic father, and her childhood sexual abuse.


I don't remember much about the early therapy other than they were rather nice, and I think we did hypnosis at least once.


[Side notes: Hypnosis has been indicated to cause [Dissociative Identity Disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociative_identity_disorder) which I definitely have battled for many years.]


In highschool I got even weirder.  :/


It was a small rural bible-belt town, and [I was a fucking alien.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI2gi9N7w5Q)


I didn't have to try really hard in school, so I didn't. I just floated through, and never got in trouble, even though everyone knew I was smoking weed every day, and pushing the boundaries of the school dress code. I got voted president of the marching band even though I never ran for it (write in candidate), and was in Academic Decathlon (won our school a gold in philosophy, a silver in english, and a couple bronze while tripping my balls off at the event.)


I was doing some self-research on psychology, and realized that I totally had OCD and Depression, so I asked to get on SSRIs, but they also gave me an anti-psychotic. That sucked.


I was self-mutilating, addicted to DXM, and writing really morbid (but good) poetry, and this was right after Columbine, so...


The highschool illegally expelled me.  :/


Lawyers got involved, and I got a free ride through a state University.


That was Junior year HS. In my senior year...


I was *untouchable*. The school system had already basically lost a case against me, so there was a standing order to not fuck with me, and just let me pass.


I slept through almost all of Bio, *even though* I told my teacher that the meds were putting me to sleep, and just wake me up, but no... she just let me sleep through the class, and passed me anyway.


At graduation, the principal approached me and said I was a half-credit short, but he was going to graduate me anyway.


Why?


Because they wanted me the fuck out of their school system.  :/


One of my other friends had *more* than enough credits, and they held him back. They just wanted to be rid of me.


So I went to ETSU for 5 and 1/2 years studying psychology, sociology, anthropology, philosophy, and art, but didn't graduate because I changed majors a few times, and then got burnt out.


I got a sweet job co-managing an awesome music venue, and dropped out. I still kinda regret that, but I couldn't really do school anymore. I was just burnt out. I'm trying to get my shit together, and go back to get a phd in philosophy, but that's another story.


While working at the music venue I became close friends with a lot of mid-level weed/shrooms dealers, and got really into Buddhism.


I had my second psychotic break from reality in 2010, but it didn't land me in the hospital. I had a really strong friend network that took care of me.


In 2012, because of my close connections with dealers my paranoia became exponential, and I ended up emaciated in the local psych ward.


In 2014 it happened again, but *this* time the love of my life left me...


I still have a really hard time with that  :(


[Side notes: I'm leaving out a lot of details here for brevity.]


Between '14, and now I've been in, and out of the psych ward usually about twice a year. 


It's been really rough, but I have a really strong support network over at r/ShrugLifeSyndicate . Those people have basically saved my life a couple times in the past two years. I'm very grateful.  <#


Anyway, yeah, that's what's up. I'm more than willing to answer any other questions you might have.

<# Thank you. It's been very difficult.[removed][removed]The experience sounds fairly similar to my prodromal phase of Schizophrenia. I am not, however, a doctor and you should really seek medical advice for the symptoms you are currently experiencing as they are clearly quite severe. If you would like support, you can always reply here or message me. I am happy to share my experiences with you. [removed][removed][deleted]I do sometimes miss the other five voices that weren't really unfriendly. Honestly, they were like siblings in a sense, especially the two that were with me from "day one". I've actually gotten into the habit of talking to myself (it's probably a bit too extreme; I do it regardless of where I am, who's around, etc., and sometimes talk about... stuff I probably shouldn't talk about in public. And I randomly just find myself saying "fuck" or "dammit" over and over again under my breath. I guess I've really integrated those voices into myself, even if they aren't "here" anymore).

I was incredibly smart when I was younger (not trying to brag, just saying), and it seems like since I started taking medications for it I've gotten a lot less so. I struggle in classes sometimes (or quite a lot for some of them), whereas before I could look at a page from a book for five seconds and then recite it word-for-word. It was certainly interesting, and, as you said, it might've been a form of integrating all of my brain together in a more streamlined way. If so, the side effects were just too much for me to handle, I suppose.

That's a rather nice way to look at it. I don't know if I'd want to even _try_ to unify the "Devil" and "God" in my mind from before. It sounds like it would end up either very good or very, _very_ bad, and a 50/50 chance for each.

Honestly, I wouldn't mind having the voices back. The hallucinations and homicidal episodes are just too severe for that to work. I still get hallucinations sometimes, but I'm generally able to tell the difference between them and reality as long as I'm keeping up with my medications, and I haven't had a relapse into homicidal ideations since I started being effectively treated for it.

Edit: phrasing.Sorry for the late reply; I haven't been on Reddit lately.

I've had insomnia for much of my life, though I'm not entirely sure what the root cause is. Medications don't work for more than a few days (a week or two at most if I continually increase the dose), and I've already worked my way through every last one the doctor can prescribe. I guess my answer to you would be that I don't; earlier this year I stayed awake for about 110 hours straight before crashing, and even then I only slept around 14 hours; my normal experience is around 3-4 hours of sleep a night, sometimes skipping a night or two.

Until things started "happening" that made me tense and uneasy all the time, I guess I was probably mostly normal. I know I gave no (noticeable) outward signs. Even from a young age I didn't mind being "alone", though, since I had company anyway, and I can remember having difficulty sleeping.58.

I first noticed her paranoia last December when she kicked the neighbours out of the house. I wish I'd taken her to a psych then but she convinced me that they were up to no good. 

Didn't notice anything amiss after that - except that she prayed a lot more - but in June my mum's delusions really kicked in. She bought the police home because she thought the neighbours had hired a hitman to take us out. She was then admitted and treated.

I have a sinking feeling I am to blame for triggering her condition. She found out about me being bi and having a boyfriend, around the same time the symptoms started to show. When I was taking her to be admitted she attacked me and yelled at me to stay away because I was going to sell her as a prostitute to Myanmar (of all places). Because that's what all sexual deviants do, apparently.my mom had caught me putting trashbags over my window to keep people from looking in. i was yelling at nothing while doing so. she brought me to my psychiatrist asap and it all pretty much clicked together after that. inbetween all this i was hallucinating brick walls, so that was another thing to add onto my case.They sound amazing.  Like the most famous choir you could hear.  It's just like most of the best things in life, too much can be damn annoying.

And yes it is funny when you think about it.  A damn choir is trolling me.  La la laaaaa.Sorry I didn’t reply sooner! I was sleeping and then at work all day. I appreciate the input from you guys. My only issue is that I’m 27 now and a bit past the typical age where onset occurrs. Not sure if anyone has any info on examples of it manifesting itself later in the 20s or even later than that?Yes, they were terrifying. i existed in a constant state of fight vs. flight since i was a child. It started off as nightmares. i started writing in my journal when i was ten years old because of my nightmares. The first time i saw something was as a teenager after my dad died.  i went into his room and there was a black-winged demon perched at the top corner of the ceiling with it's talons gripping the sides of the walls and it was telling me to get out. My blood felt like ice I was so scared. I thought the demon was there because my dad committed suicide and so he left behind his demons. I never went back in his room. But I also started to see demons in people. When i was in my early 20s I had a job as a patient sitter and i was sitting with a patient in the hospital, a teenage boy, and he looked at me and said, "I dont see them in you; you're one of the safe ones." And I knew exactly what he was talking about because I saw demons in people, too. When i see a demon in someone my blood turns to ice and i shake. I never said anything to anyone. Why? Because that was my norm. I never talked to anyone so i didnt know other people didnt feel these things. And my mother was very abusive so I just never talked in general. I had no friends. I was raised very religious so I heard all the stories about demons and hauntings from the bible, so i thought god wanted me to fight them, and i tried. People talked about this stuff at church all the time so why would it be unusual? Discussions on revelations alone made me think this stuff was normal. When i was little and i had horrible nightmares my mother told me i was having nightmares because I was a bad kid for not going to church all the time (i was tired in the mornings after having nightmares all night). She told me if i read and prayed more then god would make it stop. And the bible and church people tell you that god will abandon you to "demons" if you dont follow the rules, to pray harder, have more faith, etc. Everything in religion lends itself to psychosis. so i thought god was punishing me and if i just believed in god more then god would banish these demons from me. so i guess i never said anything because then everyone would know what a bad person i was; only evil people get visited by demons, and only those completely devoid of faith in their god cant get them to go away. I'm not sure if this is helpful or even correct, but my best guess is "cool" is another name for "ice" which is meth.  I mean be wrong though and it could be a totally different thing, but that's the best guess I could think of. Doubt meth. Likely ketamine, rohypnol, ghb or possibly phencyclidine. Some dissociative. It's relatively rare for someone to drug someone else with meth.i was on mobile, autocorrect changed it to cool. But i was drugged with PCP i believe or something to that effect.Not really, sorry. I tried to block out as much as I could because hearing voices isn't fun, but what I remember was shit like what I posted simply because no person in their right mind would voluntarily come up with a sentence like "find me a fifteen socket spider glass" or "it smells like we've been here before", which is when I started realizing that I might have a problem. It was basically like living in an outtake of something off of Trout Mask Replica.It's a great sub!Sometimes they are negative, I am learning how to screen them out with meditation and other things.

Thinking "111111111" can cancel them, or thinking "clear mind" does it as well. Buddhists call them sneaky thoughts, and tell me to imagine a kitten that grabs the sneaky thoughts like capturing a mouse or rat. Practice at it to make the kitten grow into a cat, a lion, a tiger, stronger and able to catch them before they effect you.

I need to focus on the here and now, not the alternative universes my thoughts and simulators take me to. [removed]Yeah I get them bad when I'm at my lowest and usually when I've been up all night. This has made me definitely think I might have to go see a doctor. Thanks a lot for your time ! Much appreciated ![removed]Oh god, I'm not the only one!! Please don't blame yourself for not realising that. It's a hallucination, and those don't exactly come from a place of clarity and rational thought.I have never known what that was called - but it has happened to me for years. It doesn't happen so much when I lay down for bed at night, but when I'm taking a nap or particularly feeling exhausted, I get in this state where I can hear voices talking. I feel distant from my body at the time - like I've fallen away inside myself - so its not sleep paralysis, but I've always wondered what exactly it was. Thanks for putting a name to it! Everyone experiences this from time-to time, but chronic hypnagogic hallucinations are a bad sign.

Occasionally - as in less than once per year - I'll have a sleepless night because the very moment I drift to sleep, I'll a unfamiliar voice screaming at me like "HOLY FUCKING SHIT GET OUT!", scaring the shit out of me and waking me up.  Sometimes the sound echos in my head once I wake up, force me out of bed to frantically turn on lights to prove to myself that I am alone.  Regardless, if I try to go back to sleep, it'll happen again.

Those nights I usually also have severe sleep paralysis - during which I can hear unintelligible voices growing louder and louder until I can force myself awake - the sensation of entities in the room watching me and floating over me, and a constant fear of falling asleep (because of the aforementioned symptoms)

Hasn't happened in a while, but if that shit happened every night I would absolutely be seeing a doctor about it!I'll have to look into that more! Thanks for the info. It all usually occurs as I'm getting ready to sleep and beginning to lay down. Also used to still happen when I'd walk down the hall to tell my mom when I was a kid. Used to tell my friends and they thought I was crazy  Well damn that makes sense.  I guess I only hear about instances in the US.  I also like to do free on-line counseling, and lots of stuff like that. It feels really good when people say you have helped them.Thank you for the insight.Nothing like hitting the 48 hour mark and the hallucinations are no longer a problem due to overwhelming apathy from exhaustion. Happened to me almost 5 years ago. 4 days of maybe 2 or 3 hours sleep each and working 10 hours a day. On night 5 I heard people running through my house (because this was the actual reason for no sleep, drunk housemates) but on this night it was my brain making it up. It still feels real when everyone had told me the house was quiet. I couldn't sleep because of the noise.

I lost my shit, quit my job and left my friends there with the lease. 

Nothing like that has ever happened again but I still do not feel like I ever fully recovered 100%. Serious sleep deprivation is forever.Same here peaceeeeeNo shit..this guy and this story. It's more like TLDR:I've smoked weed since I was 16, I do a lot of drugs and self diagnose. After all the drugs I do, shit goes wrong. Also drugs drugs drugs.[This is sadly enlightening to one of the worst VA systems.](http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/02/09/vets-continue-to-die-phoenix-hospital-at-center-va-scandal-ranked-among-nations-worst.html)Fuck yes! You saved me from an expensive doctor appointment. Yeah, it only ever happens when I'm stoned. The sounds of sobbing was definitely the freakiest, but it seems even lightly stoned I have a panic attack. I've grown to accept Weed just isn't for me. Thankfully I can always pickle my liver at a party and friends don't mind.I know, it hurts me so damn much, but she doesn’t want me to bc having a psychiatrist when you’re a POC is such a big taboo. Because of that, she doesn’t like me seeing one period, let alone being medicated. As an adult, she has to be a proven danger to herself and to others in order to be forcefully treated. She entirely believes in the illusions and refuses to seek help willingly. Nothing's going to happen until she unmistakably hurts someone. I have no power to help her.

She's been deteriorating for over 20 years now. It's a waiting game, sadly.In order to get someone to get mentally screened/committed unwillingly they have to be a danger to others or to themselves, and they are I believe committed for 72 hours if I remember the law correctly. However, I'm not sure if that's just a California state law thing or if other states have their own similar laws.  

EDIT: Now that I think of it, it's probably a federal law that protects patients rights regarding mental illness. If I remember correctly, back in the "olden days", a husband, parents, or guardian could simply have their loved one committed to a mental hospital for anything such as homosexuality, promiscuity, etc. and the patient had no choice or rights to really get out of it. However, I'm not a lawyer so don't quote me on this. Yeah I thought it might sound a little alarming. I have this fear of bothering people also. So I will sit in real  agonizing pain in order not to bother anyone cause I don't want it to be a waste of time for them cause in my head it's nothing  I feel like maybe my mind is making it up to get attention.  But in reality I'm actually sick.  I have had 3 emergency surgreys because I waited until the last second convincing myself I was fine. Also my mom denied thay i had something wrong with me until she saw me breaking down and having melt downs more and more with age then she apologized she just didnt want to believe I was "crazy" like her mom. Reason why I have never been diagnosed with anything not even anxiety/depression.  I take prescription meds from Mexico that helps sometimes. So getting help for myself is harder than i wish it would be.It was once I realized it was a voice and not someone trying to annoy me, this happened awhile back when I was really mentally unhealthy as well, various hallucinations happened through out that time but im now on so many meds n what not I think everything is all good.I have been and my psych's told me that Its more insecurity. Like I said its a lot of social stuff that is plausible. But I just wonder how far it is from schizophreniaSame. I'm a well functioning, sane (as far as I can tell) member of society who's experienced a lot of what people bring up. I dealt with it spiritually and am in a comfortable place with it. 
I don't have the answers to what it is, but in my core I don't think pharmaceuticals are an answer. Please don't, this is a bad LPT. Schizophrenia is a spectrum disorder with a wide variety of systems. It is true that someone with extreme delusions could believe they are fine even while medicated, but this is not always the case. Delusions are also not required for a diagnosis of schizophrenia. A better LPT would be: If you're worried you may have schizophrenia, get yourself checked. At best you'll put your mind at ease with a clean bill of mental health, at worst you'll receive a diagnosis and treatment path to improve your quality of life.Someone else was arguing the other side. But I was on the toilet when this happened.He can't tell you. How would he begin to know?Complicated: they did stuff at the beginning. Did transfer hard to deal problems to my line. Did avoid me so I could ask questions about the job. JUST in the office. To get to me. Long story short, they did Not tap my phone, did Not tail me driving around town. Did Not pose as aircraft personal, ride on the flight to Miami for my JET interview. Did Not sit at a fountain and use a laptop to Bollix the ATM I tried to use (I Now assume it was simply out of order and no one had shut it down and put a sign on it). The only other person up for the JET position was Not a planted agent placed to gather a character evaluation. The waiting room was Not a test. Etc. Chill bro. You need to go back to anger school to be less anger. I guess I had this comming.... What exactly. Imbalance of hormones, of chemicals... etc. What exactlyI have suffered almost no side effects. Just sometimes I they will make me a little tired. And I very occasionally get the odd heart palpitations. I think from taking the medication 2 years. Just 20mg I take daily. How many mg are you taking? I am so sorry for your loss 😞. I hope that you and your father are there for each other. 

I done some research on Reddit and I think the best thing to do for me now is to get my granny out and just let her experience some nice moments 😊. Will go to a spa this Saturday and have a dinner. Something just for her😊. 

Tell your dad that Reddit says “Hi!”.Dang. I work at a hospital and had a random male approach me and state there was people following him and so forth. His story sounded really inconsistent so I thought he was bulkshitting, but dude was genuinely scared out of his mind.Ah good point actually, I’m not too familiar with mental condition, forgot psychosis was also a thing. 

I won’t ask her about it in case she’s forgotten about it, best not to remind her of that time. Nah we were never religious nuts, she grew up in an Irish catholic family but never went to church when she moved to England. 

We went to the Christian church with a neighbour who also went there, lasted about 2-3 years before she realised how superficial some of the people there were. 

So I’m pretty sure it wasn’t brought on religiously, she just had a rough time those few years and snapped I guess, told a few people at the church and they wanted to perform an exorcism.  True I'm not one to self diagnose but they ARE
 accurate to myself. Hold on wait, what? This is schizophrenia??!Synesthesia is fairly common, not sure it has much to do with schizophrenia.Magic mushroomHahaha. Sorry posted in the wrong group. I am new to Reddit Multiple people know, he visits doctors, and the school is aware. It's just the conversations have gotten much longer. Pretty chilling to see it progress.Supplant? Why would I ever want to do that? Did my post come off as that? I was honestly just asking these questions because I wanted to hear personal accounts rather than read papers or studies for a change. Why would I want to supersede schizophrenic experts? I’m here to help and work with them on a common goal. Someone sent me a DM because my post is likely against the rules.  But in case this doesn’t all get deleted, apparently there is some evidence to support “positive voices” largely in non western cultures.  Here’s an article from the Atlantic on the topic:

https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/07/when-hearing-voices-is-a-good-thing/374863/
Usually at school in crowded hallways but occasionally it will happen when it's quiet which makes me think it's more along the lines of a hallucination but idkWhat were the symptoms?Sometimes they look like garden gnomes :)[removed]Well, I have had it for 20+ years, and as long as I don't suffer or pose a risk to myself or others, I'm not too worried. Ruminating and worrying just steal quality lifetime, especially if it's about stuff you can't really control, influence, neither know in advance. This is the reply I was hoping for. I was discussing it with some buddies and they all looked at me like I was mental so I felt like something was off with me lol.Sounds familiar although my hallucinations and all that are neverending[deleted]Until I was 20, I always thought that boredom made everyone physically nauseous. Then I told a group of other people that, and they looked at me funny.

I suppose what I'm getting at is this: what you think is normal (in a bubble) isn't necessarily normal if you don't have any other basis for comparison.Have you seen the movie Donnie Darko? It seems after reading this thread to be close to a first person take on a schizophrenic kid.Has medication helped? Some people feel like a shell of themselves on meds. I'm not sure if I would want to be half of myself or terrified all the time, not saying that's your experience. Good God man.My SO. He notices because I stiffen up and my breathing gets really shallow. And he will just look at me and say "Brain being a dick?" and I'm like "mhmm." Then he usually tries to distract me a bit. It doesn't happen that often anymore thanks to medication but it still pops up from time to time. They aren't necessarily startling because Im completely aware they arent real but its still really unsettling. What freaks me the fuck out is this female demonic entity that ill sometimes see after i first walk in a new room in the dark. Its hard to describe her because she's mainly just a shadow figure but when i enter i always interrupt her in the middle of rummaging through something, hunched over and always seen from the side. She then jerks her head at me kinda startled and then screams as her face flies straight toward mine and then the whole manifestation somehow dissipates inches from my eyes and the whole projection is only 2-3 seconds long. I never like to acknowledge them by giving a reaction, i just keep plain faced and continue doing whatever i was doing but it makes my heart stop everytime and though i remain expressionless i always turn sheet whiteThe female is pitch black but the hands can be grey  or foggyTheyve never grabbed me or anything but theyll come lunging towards me. The worst is when they come from the edge of my bed. Itll happen once or twice a month but i stress about the possibility of seeing them oftenDoes it help to get diagnosed? So, you're sort of seeing things and they feel absolutely real to you. You start to think you might have something wrong and go to the Dr. The Dr says you are hallucinating. Do you then feel relieved and do the visions seem less scary? Or does it feel just as scary as the first time?

I'm guessing it is equally scary because it's just a hard wired fear trigger and not tied to logical thoughthow has it almost ended you life? 

Sometimes I hear voices and I can't stand them.Do your symptoms change when you must get used to some thing new? Like a new place or roommate.   I'm sure you're aware, AHPRA requires notification only if you "place the public at risk of substantial harm". It would also need to cause issue in the course of your duties. 

If I can say, what you describe seems an unusual process. I've never seen schizophrenia without cognitive impairment. Visual hallucinations as a residual sx are also very uncommon. Was your dx definitive? Wow! That detail about liver enzymes is really neat! I'm glad I got to read your comment; hearing about something as powerful and complex as schizophrenia from the perspective of someone with a strong medical education was super interested!

I hope the rest of your education goes well and you go on to help a lot of people.Thank you very much for being so open here and answering this question.  I honestly never knew it was possible to be high functioning with schizophrenia.  I just didn't think about it, but of course, it is just like most disorders, isn't it?  Varying levels of severity.You are an absolute bad ass to be forthcoming about your condition to help lessen the stigma. That is really brave and strong. Good luck to you. There should be more doctors like you in the world. [deleted]I'm a doctor who has moderate anxiety/depression, I'm on medication for it. 
And I'm really open about it to my colleagues. I had a stigma about mental health issues before I was diagnosed and a huge factor in me finally accepting treatment was finding out that a person I really look up to and have known for years is on medication. I needed to see someone who was successful and happy to change my stigma. 

So I'm super open about my MH issues, because I know first-hand that we success stories do exist! We just are invisible if we stay quiet, and thus we ADD to the stigma, that the only people with MH issues are dysfunctional and unhappy and never get better. > I was raised in an adverse environment, and the removal of those social circumstances was the most important factor in recovery.

That's very interesting to me, and gives me a lot of hope. I cut contact with my relatives a few years ago and have some serious mental health problems thanks to their abusive behaviour. Unfortunately I still live in the same town as them and I believe it impedes my recovery - I'm terrified every time I leave my home and I try not to visit shops at times I know they could likely turn up. I'm possibly moving far away in a couple of months, and I hold out hope that it'll greatly improve my quality of mental health.

It's really great that you're doing better and that your schizophrenia has improved. You have a very positive outlook on your diagnosis and it's nice that you're so transparent about it - like you said, being open and honest about it can help reduce the stigma. Good luck in your medical studies :)> Theoretically you could cross-reference the different drugs a patient reacted adversely to, to determine which liver enzyme caused poor drug metabolism.

This seems like a job for IBM and Watson.If there is any chance at all that you can locate that liver enzyme data base, would you post it?   I Think it would be very interesting . Thanks. I was under the impression that schizophrenia was degenerative unless treated with antipsychotics, is this incorrect?As a fellow med student, what an awesome story! So great to hear you smashing the barriers :)Not sure if this might be helpful to anyone, but it's in relation to your liver enzymes note. I did an ancestry genetic test (23&me) and then ran that raw data through Promethease (5US$). Some of the results look up to liver enzymes results. I now understand why caffeine affects me the way it does, and why 4 different SSRIs never made much of a difference for me.

   Of course there could be errors for a consumer kit, but I would imagine that a doctor ordered genetic test could get you enzyme information that would allow them to make better informed medication decisions. Based on information aligning with what I learned through trial and error, I feel confident that the majority of the information in regards to meds was correct.I'm a psychologist. During undergrad and post grad, one of my friends early stated that she was diagnosed rapid cycling bipolar. We are both registered now with AHPRA. Turns out that she didn't report her diagnosis but while conducting teaching at our old uni (she went on a bit after I left and got my full registration), one of the senior clinical staff (a full professor as it turned out) dobbed her in to AHPRA. Now she has restrictions and reporting requirements on her practice, is mandated and had to pay for supervision with clinical psych and psychiatrist whom report to the board.
So yeah...she's pretty tough and is still going. One of her practice restrictions is to refrain from dealing with PD and comorbid diagnosis patients. She has to keep a log book and more extensive clinical records, along with compliance in random audits.I'm a teacher, but I'm afraid if I let it be known I have schizoaffective disorder I could lose my job. I teach adults.Poor metabolism is not the only cause of an adverse reaction. It's an unlikely cause. Adverse reactions secondary to abnormal metabolism might be corrected by dose adjustment or an alteration in dose frequency. Even drugs which are not metabolized at all but are excreted unchanged can have adverse effects.

This is not going to be the answer to your drug adverse reactions problem and certainly not the answer to your drug ineffectiveness problem.Loved every word of this! Thank you for sharing.Omg. The side effects. As I've gotten older I've become sensitive to EVERYTHING. I got SEVERE tardive dyskinesia from 80 mg Geodon (160 is therapeutic) Half a dose of Abilify gave me severe akathisia. Small dose of Invega caused me to lactate and lose the ability to control my core muscles. Topamax caused kidney stones that led to two surgeries.  Thats just medication. I also can't drink caffeine, Non-sugar (stevia, Truvia, etc.) can't be around strong smells. And SOMEHOW I tested positive for THC even though I don't smoke, Don't eat edibles, don't eat random baked goods. The only contact I have with the stuff is through my customers smelling like it and handing me money. I have no FUCKING CLUE how that even happened and frankly, it annoys me.Happen to have a link to that database? Upvote because you’re Aussie  🥃 I'm curious how you could know for sure that you weren't making a judgment on a hallucination? I know some schizophrenics can tell the difference, and some can't. As a medical professional, I know I'd be concerned about this affecting my ability. 

I give medications out in my job, and I would be concerned that one day I would be convinced I was giving the right medication when I was wrong, and hallucinating. 

I'm very curious about this, since I was a psych major, but my interaction with schizophrenic patients has been extremely limited.Could you link the liver database please? That sounds really interesting! I have a couple of older relatives who worry about the effect of medication they take, perhaps it can be used to advise on other drugs?Hey what's this database you mention? Sounds like it could be really useful for me. Thanks!
I actually had a genetic test done that showed my liver enzyme reaction to a list of psych medication. What is your relationship with your mother like now? What happened to your dad?
Do you really feel like you can be a competent health care practitioner when you still have symptoms, no matter how rarely?You should NOT be practicing medicine. Instead of going through a list of adverse interactions, patients can get a test done through genesight to help predicted med response.  It's based on liver enzymes in part but also other factors.  Also a 23andme test plus some research can work as well.  I've done 23andme and occasionally people in r/bipolar have a doc who orders genesight.[deleted]This makes me want to go to med school in Australia. I'm glad to hear that my mom is wrong :) Thank you. It took me an extra year of uni which  ended up being beneficial in terms of decreased stress levels.   Drawing comparisons I found out is unhealthy  and not relevant to your own journey.  Congratulations on being persistent and taking it at your own pace. Thank you so much. I had a really rough time adjusting to college... and then was raped during my very first quarter by a boy in my math class. I failed that class with a 0.0 GPA and did very poorly in my other classes. I was put on academic probation and I had to let go of my bioengineering degree/medical school goals.

If I had known better, I would have taken a year off to recover, travel, find myself. Instead, I rushed the rest of my undergraduate years, taking on a really tough course load just to graduate within four years. I don't know why I felt so much pressure to graduate "on time". I just never really learned how to prioritize my mental health, I guess. I graduated with a 3.2 GPA with a basic science bachelor's degree. 

Since graduating I have been moving into a progressively more clinical and academic space. I currently work in a very specific type of clinical diagnostic lab within my alma mater's medical center. My alma mater's medical school is also one of the best in the country, so it does feel like some accomplishment. And it is very cool to work with the physicians and other clinicians in my dept. We're working on some research which is hopefully going to be published, I hope. 

A few months ago, I got into a huge car wreck, totaling my car. I ended up deciding to move back home with my parents so that I could bike/bus commute to work, but it takes 3.5 hours out of my day. It's been really difficult living with them again, and I'm ashamed of it and hate admitting that to my friends, coworkers, and even strangers. I can afford to live on my own, close to work, in a very expensive city, but I don't consider it a very financially smart decision. I have school to pay for. I don't make much in my current position, as most low level healthcare workers do. 

I have recently decided that I can't give up my dreams of becoming an MD. During my 3.5-4 hour daily commutes, I listen to a premed podcast. I've learned a lot and know what I need to do to get into medical school. It's a hard and long road ahead of me, but I've never felt so committed and resolute about anything before. It's a huge relief to finally let myself pursue this. Before, I was so afraid of failure that I didn't even admit it to myself that this is the only thing that I want to do. 

It's mostly a wonderful thing and I sometimes catching myself smiling big when I'm listening to my podcast or thinking about my future aspirations. It's hard, too. Many people my age (25) are already in medical school, and some are already finished. My best friend is in her first year of law school. After her three year law program, she'll be a Juris Doctor. She'll have a Doctorate. And I will, best case scenario, be starting medical school. It's hard for me to think about. She's one year younger than I am, and it seems like she's so much farther ahead in life than I am. People are getting married, popping out babies, having wonderful beautiful lives, and I am living at home with my parents, single, and at times, scared. I don't know what my life will look like. If I'll ever find anyone, if I'll ever become a doctor, if I'll ever have the life I dreamed of with many fur-babies (dogs), financial stability and independence - and mostly - the ability to help others, not need help. 

Your comment has reminded me that what I'm feeling is very normal for the situation that I'm in. I'm determined to keep my head down and continue striving towards my dream. Everyone goes through life at a different pace, everyone is going through something. It makes me so mad that I was set back by what happened during my first year of college because I've grew up on the word "precocious". It defined me to exceed expectations in school, sports, everything. Despite all this, I suppose that what happened contributes to who I am today and hopefully it will help me be a more empathic person and therefore a better doctor. I still find myself learning from it today, almost 6 years later. 

Anyway, thank you. It was so interesting reading through your conversation in this thread and your story gives me a lot of hope that I too, have a shot at my dreams. It.. is comforting knowing that the people who are successful don't have to be the perfect, faultless people that I imagine them to be. They can be like me. It's OK to have gone through abuse/trauma, or in your case, to be diagnosed with a highly stigmatized mental illness. 

I've rambled long enough. Best of luck to you in your journey through medical school and beyond. Thanks again, you really helped me tonight. This is one of the best things i have heard in a long time . I had Stress Adjustment Syndrome but i would really love to get into medicine.  I am in WA . What is the process of application ?  Any advice . I am 35 , is that too old ? I am very happy to see all of these on here of people doing really well and able to live with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar 1.  I work at at an inpatient psych hospital so I only see people when they are not stable.  I have also seen the same people over and over again for years due to non-compliance of meds.  I don't want to patronize people by saying "good job", but it is making me so incredibly hopefull about when I see new psychotic breaks in young adults.  !!! Oh wow i think I know what uni you're at! I was in that talk, and went up to talk to him about OCD at the end. I don't disclose it to uni/now my employer, as people tend to be pretty awful tbh. Seeing him be so successful gives me hope that our generation can change things.

Good luck, and for what it's worth I think you'll be a fantastic doctor. Those of us who've had experiences in the mental health system are at an advantage in dealing with many things, I think - the way psychiatric conditions are discussed in medicine is often awful and dehumanising, despite the high rate in our cohort, and I hope we change it. I would have loved to hear that seminar. As a PhD student in Australia with multiple mental illnesses I find that there is not enough awareness, support and advice on how to cope with mental illness and study/work.A med school classmate of mine was diagnosed with schizophrenia shortly before graduating from undergrad. When the school found out of his diagnosis they kicked him out, but they used his borderline failing grades as an excuse. I knew his academic troubles stemmed from him being overly neurotic about various things, but he did not disclose his diagnosis to me until I let him crash on my couch for a couple months to keep him from becoming homeless. He had lost a research job and his dad kicked him out. Eventually he went back to his parents house, but that was an unhealthy environment for him. A couple years later he committed suicide. I still think if the school had been more supportive, he would be a pathologist today.Bless you, man!! Your experience will help when you may come across patients that feel trapped. Somehow I think this will help greatly. Empathy really helps, I've learnt!
I too, was under the impression that people with mental conditions would be somehow barred from getting into medicine. I'm glad you can do this where you are.My GP (Aus) is bipolar, and upfront about it. Very disarming, and I think he is awesome.Oh now I know what they meant, I think. Do you mean like a schizophrenic that will say tap their finger against their mouth 10 times before they'll come out the bathroom or something like an OCD display(as it's presented.)Tiptoeing CAN be the sign of something else. I did it as a kid and found out years later I have shortened Achilles tendons. Kids will tiptoe with this because it is easier on the feet and legs. I STILL tiptoe if my feet or legs REALLY hurt and I am 27 years old.I’ve worked with a lot of people with autism. In my experience, many of them walk on their tiptoes. I have schizoaffective and toewalked until I was 18 or 19. I still do it when I forget to walk with flat feet. I began showing symptoms of schizoaffective when I was eight or nine, but had been walking on my toes from the time I began walking.I'm autistic and I often walk on my toes when I'm barefoot. That definitely is a sign of that. Yea, also seems like there are some similarities in the personalities and quirks for lack of better word between schizophrenics and autistic people, so maybe we also share walking mannerisms.That could actually be the medication, but I know with my schizophrenia I felt like I had to walk a certain way in order for things to be ok, like not get attacked by a random stranger or something.But beware, that cannot be diagnostic. I walk stiffly but don't have schizophrenia. My body was ravaged by Lyme Disease 9 years ago which did some nerve damage and I have essential tremor, which makes me somewhat out of balance (the stiff gait is my body protecting me against losing my balance).My mom used to yell at me when I was a kid to swing my arms as I walked 'like a normal person', because as I walked I held my arms straight to my sides. Dopamine antagonists are mainline antipsychotic therapy and have been since the 1950s. The stiff walk should be expectedHave you found yourself doing other things, like having to move a certain way for some reason like if you don't something will happen?Actually it's probably worse without the meds because I feel like I have to do strange things when I'm unmedicated...the meds might make my leg abnormally stiff so I walk with a gimp but to me that's a side effect of the meds not the schizophrenia.Me too! Except instead of selling my soul, I was convinced a vampire would come suck my blood from my neck. I had to sleep with a sheet pulled around my neck and tucked under my head to keep it secured so the vampire wouldn't get me while I slept. Even on blazing hot summer nights I did this.

I also had to step a certain way (going up steps I had to step with my left foot first; walking anywhere, I couldn't step on cracks; if there were bricks on the street I could only step on the ones that were "going in my direction"). I also had to chew a certain way; the right side always had to get a little more food than the left, and it got the "better" stuff (like when eating M&Ms, right side gets the blues or the greens, left side gets browns and yellows).

And I STILL get paranoid that saying or doing certain things will "jinx" the turnout. If I hope too much for something, it won't happen. When I was a server, as we were coming towards closing time, if someone talked about how quiet it was or the cooks asked how many people were in the restaurant, I'd get mad because them saying that was going to make people come.Super weird. I experienced something similar. Emphasis on the soul thing, as well. I was terrified Of being "possessed by the devil" and for years would pray every night that I wouldn't be and lived in constant fear. Obviously no longer do. Same. Same same same. Really interesting how many people thought this as well. My situation started after my brother showed me the Exorcist. I'd be so scared to accidently happen upon it around Halloween time to season. The only thing I thought I had was OCD, because I'd have to tap my feet on the ground 4 sets of 4 times PERFECTLY before I could go to bed. It was awful. Never had any sort of thought tho. I, too, have had these thoughts and still walk like this. Guess I'll be sleeping with the light on tonight after reading these stories.Same. I believe the experience is quite different for people who are schizo than us who are not but had experiences that sound the same Maybe the devil thing is religious beliefs being harmful and frightening for a little child. Many children brought up fundamentalist fear hell. I think this is child abuse.Thats what i was thinking. I have ocd and thats what i was like as a kid.Is OCD something that tends to go away on its own? I don't have those symptoms as an adult.Lots of sibling comments to yours that came later ate mentioning OCD.  If you haven't already, perhaps read up on it and /or discuss it with a psychiatrist. If that turns out to be an accurate diagnosis it may relieve your stress and possible schizophrenia, and allow you to get help appropriately taillight your situation. How old are you?

I think I agree with the majority of people here who think I demonstrated a kind of OCD, rather than schizophrenia. But either way, if you've got stuff going on, you should talk to someone.

One thing I know -- schizophrenia tends to display in men at around the age of 18. In women, it tends to occur in their late 20's. However, I think there are a lot of other possible explanations in your case.Scrupulosity rings a bell.

As an adult, I am a Catholic, who teaches at a Catholic school, who, quite honestly, doesn't put a whole lot of weight or consideration into traditional religious beliefs. I'd say I don't particularly believe in the existence of a devil, for example. It's interesting how one's views can change.Pretty much everybody who read my "symptoms" suggest OCD. And I very clearly don't have schizophrenia. So, no, I don't think it could be, for what it's worth. He seems to be coping with it surprisingly well at times. although I have just had to remove the wardrobe out of his bedroom and redecorate it because he was convinced there was a camera on top of it and he also hoards rubbish in his room. i had to literally use a shovel to clean it up .

I'm not sure if this is part of the disorder (he's not diagnosed so no idea what's actually wrong with my kid) but the other day he was sitting quite happily next to me on the sofa then suddenly completely changed. It looked like my son but his facial expressions, tone of voice and even the way he held himself  changed and he started going on and on about being watched and he knew people were coming to get him but couldn't tell me who. it was like a 5 minute rant then he went back to his usual self. i just sat there and listened to what he was saying but didn't try to correct his delusions.  i hope I'm doing the right thing. 
 I could hug you right now. I live in an area where treatment for RAD as an adult isn't really possible (My local mental health clinic doesn't even have a psychologist on site. We have a nurse practitioner who should NOT be working with the mentally ill. She mocked me for wanting off bipolar meds because of severe side effects. They kept me drugged up and depressed for years because they were afraid of me being a TINY bit manic.)

I regularly do all my own research. I know A LOT about psychology and generally deal with my problems on my own. I taught myself how to manage my OCD (Can't take meds because I'm allergic) I am teaching myself to manage my occasional mania, and I taught myself how to manage my compulsive shopping. Essentially, I started doing CBT... before I even knew what CBT was. And this forum will help me along my path. Thank you so much kind stranger, it means the world to me!!!Did I mention I was from Australia? Did you know? Also is if I am going to be honest with you, I’m not really comfortable with talking. If find typing much better. I’d rather not give my age but I am below 18, above 14. I tried 2 sites. One suggested other websites on anxiety but they were little help and the other, the chat didn’t work. Waited for 10+ minutes and nothingHuh, interesting that some disorders have chronic inflammation. Thanks for this! I'd actually love some literature if you recommend anyI am, thanks!

Luckily my symptoms were caused by my alcohol consumption and repeated withdrawals. At first my psychiatrist was puzzled that my symptoms didn't present until I was 26. I was put on an antipsychotic which made them go away, but as soon as I stopped taking them the voices came back (as I was still drinking heavily). It wasn't until I checked myself into rehab and the doctors there wanted to see if it was the alcohol or truly schizophrenia. They took me off the antipsychotic and watched me for a few days, told me if I heard or saw ANYTHING to report it to them. It completely stopped while I was in treatment. I'm still sober but every now and then I will hear the indistinguishable chatter coming from vents, fans, any kind of white noise really.. but it's rare. I think maybe I just tapped into that part of my brain so I'll still experience slight symptoms.Wouldn't they only work if the sound was not imagined? It's possible.. as the voices and breathing generally were triggered by hearing white noise; the air from vents, fans, rushing water (try getting into a tub when you're being screamed at through the drain). But if I heard no noise at all, it's possible the voices wouldn't have surfaced. [deleted]God, if I didn't know that sleep paralysis was a thing, I would have totally believed I'd been abducted by aliens or something after my most vivid hallucination. Normally I can keep calm by reminding myself that it's not real, but when you go from "sensing" someone evil in your room to feeling their breath on your face, it's hard to convince yourself it's all in your head...I've experienced sleep paralysis, and was *convinced* somebody had broken into my apartment and fallen asleep on the floor. He sounded large, and was snoring. 

Too frozen with fear to move, I lay there for a while, until I was finally able to turn around slowly............and it turned out to be the cat.

Luckily I don't get a lot of these experiences, but agree our brains are evil pranksters.I tend to think that the bible was more of an attempt to explain things that science now does. But yes, hallucinations/dreams as well!Burning bush that causes visions = psychedelic drug.I posted it and then noticed others already said the same thing. But they might be shadow people anyway :-pWhat did he say?Okay thanks, that is good to hear.  Seems like I'm slightly after schizophrenia age too, although I guess it can happen at anytime.[removed][removed][removed]Honestly mental disorders scare me more than basically anything in this world. A hell you can't escape.Fuck me, right?I just came straight from the paranormal thread. Haha I'm dumb."I'll just open one more thread to read while I run to the bathroom before I go to sleep."

Ha.It's 6 a.m., I haven't slept, and I'm 3 comments down. Wish me luck.I genuinely don't understand why that's scary. Someone else experienced an auditory hallucinationBravery?

Loive of pain?

Idiocy?

Needed to reference something to be afraid of in the middle of the night?It's okay. It's all in their heads.I think it was intentionally posted at this time of night- sneaky..................................If her blankets and sheets start nonsense I'll be impressed (and terrified)

I've made sure her room isn't creepy because the last thing I need is a weird shadow on the baby monitor at 4 am

Actually she has this one keyboard toy (b's meowsic keyboard)that fucking purrs an hour after you walk away from it if it's not turned off

Guess how I found out about that oneI appreciate this!

I do this every night, he's former military so I've had alot of nights alone.  I'm comfortable in it but still terrified of the dark.

I'm not scared of an intruder, I'm scared of ghostly things.  

We have a stair gate at the top of the stairs, so I'd hear if someone came in from there. I've laid in bed forming a plan for how I react when someone breaks in before. I know I'm safe, I know I have nothing to be scared of but still.

I've gotten bettter...less scared since I've had my daughter, mainly because I don't want her to also be scared of the dark, so I try my hardest to hide itMaybe that's ut,the vulnerable feeling?

Idk my sister and parents were never afraid,  my mom dismissed my fears, my dad would talk to.me about it try and explain the logical parts of whatever I was scared of. Which I actually use now.  But even in that way they were mostly dismissive in a "she just has an over active imagination"which I get.

But when you have a grandma standing over you watching you sleep and you wake up to her standing there inches from your face, that's gonna give you a start, and then she vehemently denied it, so I felt crazy

Growing up when loigical couldn't win over my fears my dad would quietly remind me I was safe and nothing could get me if mom and dad were around.  Which is awesome when your 5 but when you're 25 living across the country and you're scared it does Jack shit lolSeek help.>  I find myself struggle with sleeping without someone I trust in the room

I'd never sleep if this was the case lol. Husband works nights and he's former military so I've been alone,alot.

I actually binge on scary movies when he's home at night for an extended period of time because obviously he protects me. And I'm fine those nights, it's the 4th night after he goes back to work that I'm silently freaking outNot so much what was said but more the "space under my bed" is threatening I would except 2 things.

I cannot for thr life of me sleep during the day,never have

And also,work starts at 7 am sooooooooooSo I'm afraid of the dark but I really hate sleeping with lights on. I apparently really enjoy waking up to pee and seeing a shadow a d having a heart attack and waking all the way up and then not ever going back to sleep

This sounnds like a nice and not scary breakdown.......or was it scary?MeanIt was also mentioned on a ‘news magazine’-type TV show I can’t recall now. Might have been a mental health segment on a cable news channel? I don’t know, but it concurred with what you said about the cultural differences.

One of the parts that also struck me was that in India and other “maternity-centric” countries (not quite matriarchal, but a cultural tendency to encourage reverence of the mother figure of the family, I suppose?), schizophrenia sufferers with auditory hallucinations generally heard very maternal voices giving praise or gentle consternations. Sometimes the voices would guilt-trip the person constantly about doing certain things or not, like going to the doctor.

The voices were generally helpful.African here. Among some Pentecostal Christian denominations, there is the belief that some people get the gift of prophecy from the Holy Spirit. Talking directly to God  sounds an awful lot like hearing voices. I also remember reading this in an article but I can't remember where goddammityes, because it's self reporting it can be indicating a number of correlations, which are really up to conjecture at this point.  you can make nearly any argument about culture based on self report, and the interpretation often says more about cultural attitudes than anythingDo you think anything you experienced or maybe something you watched when you were younger had any influence on this voice?No, I’ve read all through that and it isn’t quite the same.  They aren’t dreams, they’re right there with me and I can move all I want

They’ll crawl on my walls or stand in the corner or float through my window...  I’ve had friends with sleep paralysis before and they never seemed to have anything like thisActually I think this is it!  Thanks :)I'm sorry to hear that. As a child I had ptsd and couldn't sleep sometimes because I could still hear screaming children. I imagine what you went through to be ten fold that if not more. How is it today? Is it any different?[deleted][removed]This, forever and always this. 

Sometimes, I mentally scream "GET OUT OF MY HEAD," just to see if people react. I don't know what I'd do if they actually did, though...I'm sitting on the toilet, and about to shower. After reading this comment thread, I'm terrified and paranoid. But this is a thing neurotypical people do too, right? Like isn't being like Oh that's bad I shouldn't think that just in case, pretty normal? Exactly this. I don't THINK that I'm schizophrenic though... I seriously hope not, that's always been a fear of mine.Fucking this omg. I used to think in my second language so they couldn't understand lol being a kid was weirdPlenty of people think that God is always watching.It doesn’t matter who’s watching,

*taps head*

If you don’t have any shame about what you’re doing.I just let lose with my thoughts, I got a hell of a poker face though so I could be showing them respect while simultaneously thinking about bashing their head into the wall. I’m not even a very violent person and I rarely disrespect anyone. I believe letting my thoughts run wild has helped me be on the good side of nearly everyone.Jesus.Wait I'm sorry excuse my ignorance, is this a symptom? I've always struggled with this in addition to I have a lot of obsessive tendencies where I'd have to touch things a certain amount of times with all of my fingers if I accidentally touched something in addition to I can only have numbers on evens or multiples of 5.. like if I didn't do those things it would eat at my mind, felt like my insides were uncontrollably itchy. It's important to note that I always assumed I just had OCD and also both schizophrenia and OCD runs in my family..I’ve had this too but not bad as I grew older. It’s still there a little bit does that mean I would be schizophrenic? Scrupulosity.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrupulosity

I have this in spades.This is so relatable. This goes one step further for me, because I always get the sensation that someone is watching me THROUGH MIRRORS. Makes having a wank in the bathroom a hell of a lot more uncomfortable.Are you schizophrenic? That's not unusual in people with other disorders, or who are subclinical.Fuck it, my take is if they wanna listen then too bad they have to listen to it ALL. %90 of my life is consumed by *just in case*I am bipolar (With a plethora of others, including ADHD, PTSD, OCD, and RAD) And I do this all the time, mainly as a way to control my bipolar. I am SUPER sensitive to medication so I almost NEVER on anything that is a therapeutic level.

(Being told that "God" is ALWAYS watching you and that my adoptive mother had "Eyes in the back of her head" didn't help much either)

Bipolar, when severe has hallucinations and delusions. I am severe enough to get them from time to time. I previously lived in a haunted house. Everytime something happened I had to ask people if they experienced it too. If they did not, I wrote it off as my bipolar.  We had EVERY type of experience in that house. Apparitions (Not seen by me thankfully) Knocking, walking, phantom smells, talking, lights flickering, objects moving, furniture shaking, disembodied breathing, shadow people, shadow cat (that followed us, think its attached to a used couch) cat ghost (not the shadow, it was orange, Never saw it myself but several other people did. I do not own an orange cat), disembodied meows. Used some ghost app and it repeated the same word for 2 hours, though I cannot remember what it was at the moment. Every experience I mentioned was experienced by people other than JUST me. Surprisingly enough. It was a pretty comfortable house, I didn't feel like I was in danger. Fred (the ghost, it was my deceased step grandfather, confirmed by people he talked to and saw the apparition who had never met him but recognized him in a photo) Liked to prank people in life, so I think he just liked to remind us he was there from time to time. It was not CONSTANT activity, we'd get a surge for a bit and then nothing for several monthsI also have security routines in case I happen to run into someone who can read minds. I swap the language I'm thinking in, I think, "**GET OUT OF MY MIND**", "**PRIVACY**" or "**STOP READING MY MIND**". I also stop thinking randomly, and use obscure codes while thinking. All of this because of the little part of my brain telling me "on the offchance that someone can do it". I don't police what I'm thinking that much, I just make it difficult to understand.This is actually a pretty good policy. You're less likely to be caught red-handed by someone.It's not that weird. It's kind of the foundation of religion.This is basically my childhood until I rejected the Catholicism I was indoctrinated intoI always used to get this with girls as a kid. I'd constant force myself not to think about sexual stuff around them because I was afraid they'd see lol. Me too and I’ve never been diagnosed with anything other than anxiety. Sometimes at night when my fan is running and I️ am trying to fall asleep (under a lot of pressure), I️ feel like I️ can hear very, very, very quiet piano cords. My dad has schizophrenia. I️ have spent most of my life afraid I️ would too. I️m 27 years old and not sure if this is just my stress making my fears manifest.  When I️ relax and tell myself. “So what? If you have it and soft piano chords are all you have, then just relax and enjoy the music.” When I️ calm down it goes away.

The sound is so soft that between the hum of my fan and ambient sounds, it’s almost like my mind is idly trying to hear a song.

Should I️ get checked out do you think? I thought this because my religion taught me that a man in the sky could hear, and was judging, my every thought. Religion-induced paranoia.I still feel this way sometimes and don't have schizophreniaI'm almost 40, and i still wonder if people can read my mind. When you 'say' something to someone in your head and they turn and look at you.I never thought that people could read my mind when I was a kid, but I was convinced that everyone was in on a plot against me. I think it stemmed from something my mom said when I was probably 4 or 5. I eventually outgrew this. We know>I always felt like people could hear what I was thinking, even though I knew intellectually that this could not be so.

Safe to assume you're not married.

edit: But seriously, I have personal interest in this illness, it has affected my life, and my brother's life. Just wanted to bringa little levity, and not look like a lurker jerk.It is normal. Just regular anxiety It is, not even part of a disorder, lots of people experience imaginary audiences. Quite common in adolescence, and not uncommon to continue with age.It is normal.  I don't think it's normal to the degree I have experienced it. [removed]I was the same way. I was constantly aware of someone watching me even when I was alone. I would hide in my dark closet to change so no one could see me.

I don't feel like this as strongly now, but still do to some degree.I tend to think that's typical for puberty. I remember being in middle school and if someone got spotted adjusting a wedgie or picking their nose it was a huge joke topic for a few days before everyone got tired of mocking the poor kid or something else drew their attention. Whenever I was at school I was always hyper aware that anyone could be paying attention to what I was doing even if they didn't seem to be, just because kids are jerks at that age. Puberty sucks.Yes, the discipline thing makes sense.  Not everyone who experiences symptoms has schizophrenia, but the degree to which you suffer from your symptoms is important.  If it doesn't affect your life very much, you are probably off the hook.Do you sometimes feel like you’re an anxious and defensive person? This can lead to thoughts that people are out to get you. 

Source: My therapist  Your description of your experience is spot on with mine. My formal diagnosis is BPD, but experience many common schitzophrenia symptoms in a fairly 'mild' way if that makes sense.  Not by itself.  It is one of many, many symptoms.  A headache doesn't mean you have a brain tumor.Not by itself.  It is one of many symptoms.BPD is my main diagnosis, with a splash of a few other things.  It seems to me there are many crossover symptoms with many of these diagnoses.  My manic times are when I am least likely to experience the feeling of being watched.  I'm so active and engaged that I feel like another, happier and more productive person. My mania is so beneficial in my life I crash hard when it passes.I'm glad.  It makes me feel less marginalized. Reddit armchair psychiatrists are a dime a dozen.It was do or die.  I could not live like that. I am the owner of my thoughts, and I had to recognize these thoughts were part of a dialogue I was having with myself on some level.  I break down the thought ('you are fat and disgusting') to it's most helpful layer. (You are unhappy with the way you look and feel).  I had to stop being scared/angry about the thought and give attention to the helpful part.  When I address the core issues, I can see what the anger/fear is about and tackle THAT problem, instead of focusing on the negative feelings the thoughts provoke.  I hope that makes sense.The people in life being actors is extremely relatable.  I too realize this is not true, but the feeling is unshakable at times.Treatment is why I can live peacefully now.You rock :)Perhaps I should have clarified that these thoughts have controlled my life, and changed who I was in the past.  That is why it was a problem, not the content of the thoughts themselves. If you are managing your life well and these thoughts don't make you change your behavior, you are probably good to go.Better lifestyle.  Maybe some therapy if it interferes with your enjoyment of life.  Your thoughts are your own, and you can learn to manage them.Perhaps it's a developmental stage that most of us pass through.  Still working on passing through it!I don't know if it's an indicator, just one of the conditions I experience.  I have never told anyone about it before this.If your life is negatively affected by your thoughts, you have reached the point where it would be helpful to seek treatment.  I can relate to all but the urge to kill secret tellers (that's dark man).  There is no secret I could ever tell that would make me ashamed of myself.  I've lived through a lot and when I knew better, I did better.  Anyone who wanted to judge me wouldn't likely withstand the force of my response to their ignorance.  A terrible loss for your family.  I hope you are doing okay. definitely My experience leads me to think you are correct.  I have chosen to behave as if this IS true, and it limits the negative associations these thoughts have.  Not at all.  I treat online activity in the same way.  I am very transparent with myself.  Anything I say out loud or write down anywhere is subject to the same internal scrutiny.  When you feel watched INSIDE, being watched outside is less problematic, and more an extention of the concept of being monitored in general.  My Reddit name should reflect that I'm not hiding and I don't care who reads what I write.  No.  It's the understanding that my behavior is never really secret, and not are my thoughts.  Like a moral authority that will rat me out.I do this too. I'll do a double take at the window, then slowly lean in and give the expression as if I'm seeing something out there. Hoping it'll scare off the people watching.No.  According to the replies, it's very common and everyone has this. No.  There was no religious instruction at all in my home.No it doesn't mean you have a mental health issue, but you do have a lot of unnecessary shame.  My issues have nothing to do with being ashamed, it's more like having a moral gestapo in my head.  There are thoughts I wasn't allowed to have in my head, ways of thinking that kept me frightened and controlled from inside.  Fear based programming that had to be rooted out and replaced, thought by thought.  I still have all of the same programming 'running' in the background, but I don't respond to it very much anymore, except when triggered unexpectedly.Really, you have no idea what it's like to live in someone else's head.  If there were a god, I would hope he'd give everyone a taste of how it feels for me. I think this definitely happens to everyone and I wouldn't quantify it as one of my symptoms.  According to the messages and comments it's quite normal.  I wouldn't worry if it hasn't controlled your life.Absolutely.  I don't believe it is to the degree that I experience it, however.  It has controlled everything I think or do for as long as I can remember.  This thread is the first time I've ever admitted it to anyone.Lucky Him.Before drugs I would explore good nutrition, proper sleep and regular exercise.  Cognitive behavioral therapy is important to break down bad thought processes and replace them with a better structure.  After these avenues are satisfied, drugs will likely help the symptoms that still remain, but it wouldn't be my first course of action.quality post manI'm a medical doctor and I second this post! Having hallucinations is a quite common symptom in the general population - and if it doesn't interfere with your daily life or ability to connect with those around you, there's not much to worry about! 

@OP - how do you feel about the current movement that stresses schizophrenia doesn't exist? (As there's a range from continous imperative hallucinations + negative symptoms and attributory delisions etc to someone having had a psychosis twice). Just curious to know what someone with first-hand experience thinks.[deleted]This. I like to be alone, so people think I'm a loner. I don't want people dealing with me when I have episodes. I don't want people experiencing my experiences. [deleted]I concur 100%. We classify people as having something "wrong" with them so very easily. I have a genuine disorder, an anxiety one (with dissociative traits) which *has* affected my life significantly in the past, and potentially in the future. Much of this suffering definitely came about by me worrying about becoming **different**, or not being **normal anymore**. **But** I have done a whole load of thinking about mental health, the subjective reality and social norms/stigma/education. Also via my Neuroscience major and general interest I think you enunciate something which is likely one of the greatest misunderstandings/lack-there-of really in our **entire world**. We *don't* teach children or teens about the mind in general. We *don't* teach any general mindfulness and generally people *really* **don't** understand the fundamentals of **reality** and so classify people outside of the "normal" reality easily, which results in stigma and hence unnecessary suffering for many individuals. This includes myself. The nature of *human* reality is inherently **subjective**. People don't get this, each and every person has a) sensory "equipment" and b) a brain to process the information produced from these (already subjective) sensors. Both in sensation *and* perception there are dozens of modalities/dimensions all with the capacity for **variation** and **error**. Our nervous system allows us to experience a *somewhat accurate* (on the average) perception of the objective world but it is **by no means perfect**. Each and every person has a different subjective reality, a different experience of the world but the thing is that these variations (per individual) lie on a normal (ish) distribution. This means that most people have variations in their subjective realities that are minor enough to go undetected and **hence** the false idea that there is one objective/"normal" reality. The people on the extremeties of said distribution simply display more evident variations in their subjective reality yet we *categorise* and ostracise these variations without *even understanding the process/nature of them, even the nature of the mind*. There is nothing wrong with a schizophrenics brain really, they simply see the world more differently than the average person to a point where it is evident in comparison. It even highlights the beauty of how the brain perceives the world and provides insight into perception. What do we need? **Education**. **Psychology/Basic Neuro in high school MANDATORY. Why isn't it?! The very mechanism by which we experience EVERYTHING in our world should be a crux in the education system/society no?!**.Just wanted to add that narcolepsy is often misdiagnosed as schizophrenia due to hallucinations caused by the brain jumping into REM while you are awake.   
I can't speak for those with schizophrenia, but as a narcoleptic I can now(post diagnosis) tell what's not real due to the dream like quality of whatever I'm seeing.      
It took drs a loooong time to figure out what was going on with me.   
I just wanted to add this for anyone reading and this information might help them out. A sleep study can detect the irregularities in the brain waves during sleep for a diagnosis.   
Thank you. This is by far the best comment on this thread so far. Could you also please explain shadow people. I'm not too sure what that means. Are they really made of shadow in your view or is it a figurative shadow, where the person just follows you around?insightful, thanks for posting!If I had the spare cash to gild you I would. So many people need to understand this. It's especially funny because so many people say things on a regular basis to the effect of "I swear someone is watching me" or "I could have sworn someone was behind me" and other similar things. But when it gets just a tad bit more frequent and slightly more intense suddenly you're completely mentally unstable even if it doesn't really affect your day to day life. My experience on the matter comes from depression, so my opinion might not be 1:1 with schizophrenia, but I can definitely understand where you are coming from. And the only way to fix this mass misunderstanding is to teach the masses why it's wrong to pigeon hole people, which is a very tall order, especially considering how set in their ways some people are.> However, many of us will claim to have depression or anxiety when asked about it because the stereotype of schizophrenia is this horror-movie trope where you're babbling in a corner by yourself. 

Same thing with autism. I find a lot of people who saw Rain Man or have an autistic relative and think autism means you need help dressing yourself. They're resistant to the idea that they probably interact with autistic people in real life on a regular basis and don't know it.There is one reason to see a professional, even if occasional symptoms don't seem to have a big impact: Sometimes people don't know what "normal" is. 

Until I got meds that fit really well, I had no clue how easy life is for people without depression. I seriously thought everyone felt like lead and everyone was close to tears from exhaustion all day, every day, like me, they were just tougher and covering it up better. 

When you've lived with something for a very long time, it just becomes normal reality. That's how things are. It can be helpful to check with someone who has experience, whether your baseline of "everything's alright" is realistic. Hi. So my best friend of 15 years recently ripped into me. Completely out of the blue telling me how he's sick of me spreading rumours about him being gay, amongst other things, how he'd overheard me talking about him so many times. This has never even crossed my mind and never happened, and he was very pissed with me, the fact that I reacted with disbelief rather than with guilt. How I managed to infiltrate his work and spread this rumour baffles me?

How do I start to repair the friendship without bringing  this up? Should I  just ignore it and let him continue thinking those voices/thoughts are real. Do I even mention the word schizophrenia?
I mentioned in the past how I think every person should face up to their own shit - but he's never wanted to hear anything of the sort.
I worry for the guy because honestly he is a legend, such a good guy, but letting this stuff get to him has really knocked him down.


And then, anecdotal, but what is the effect of someone with schizophrenia tripping on magic mushrooms?



From about 20 onwards some of my more hippie friends would get us involved in some shroom trips. I've always had positive experiences overall on psilocybin and have always felt spiritually renewed afterwards.



But my friend, well the best description I have of him on the stuff is golem. 

He would become golem, shoulders hunched, sneaking around, not really able to talk and just making random noises.

Terrified look on his face, especially when it was a very visual trip. He would freak out at the view, at "things" around him. So on our trips there would always be someone looking after him.

But the strange thing was, during those trips he would suddenly shout out " What are you insinuating?!?" "I'm sick of this bullshit talking behind my back!" etc.

Aiming this rant at any one of us on the trip. Because I was his best friend those people would then look to me. I would shake my head like don't worry he's just tripping and we'd go on like nothings happened, never mentioning it again.

This would happen pretty much every trip - and I always thought he's just got shit to deal with.



Shrooms and schizophrenia - anyone know anything?


Again anecdotal, but you know when you get drunk you kinda become someone else? I would become a cocky asshole, but this same friend, when he gets drunk he literally becomes Crazy-eyes AKA Scatman. It's freaky to now think if this alternate persona (a crazy fun-loving drunk) is a result of possible schizophrenia?



How do I talk to the guy? How do I support rather than condemn? 

He doesn't want to hear shit from me at the moment. 
This post just completely changed how I think about mental illness.Really kind and insightful post. Thank you for the insight. I'm glad you've written thins.

I've spent years having visual hallucinations. Never auditory though.

My reflection is the worst. I'll watch my face melt and be replaced by something that screams silently at me as I try to brush my teeth.It will turn away when I try to look at something up close (although I do wish it'd turn all the way round so I could see the back of my head properly).

The lion that runs next to the bus/car/train I'm on, jumping from roof to roof to keep up with me. He's the one who stands on clifftops or high places with me and without words subtly tries to convince me that it'll be fun to jump (I stay away from heights because it's too tempting to try)

The shimmers that run across the floor and hide under my sofa or bed when I'm trying to do stuff. They're always in the corner of my eye and recently they've been trying to hide behind me. It's really hard to ignore them when I'm dealing with a customer or someone at work but they're there, trying to be sneaky.

It's how it's always been for me. It used to frighten me when I was younger but I accept them.

I guess I probably seem incredibly vain the amount of time looking at myself in a mirror or a reflection in a window. I'm just watching my face meltTrue true doctors told me something interesting about a friend though. If it’s part of you’re base personality whatever they are giving you may not even do anything.

Schizophrenia seems to be linked to a heightened sense of paranoia. My friend always locks their apartment door the second it is unlocked, blocks the door with a table and pulls all the furniture out from the wall. Schizophrenia isnt part of their base though.  It came from a phychotic break.Thank you for this. 

My family has a history of schizophrenia and I've been worried I'll develop it all my life. It started with my great grandmother as far as I know she would run out on the street in her nightgown screaming about aliens coming to take everyone.  My grandmother has told me some horror stories about how she punished my grandmother and her siblings. I don't know what happened to her, just that she was taken away a lot and given electo-shock treatments.

 Then, my grandmother's sister developed it and convinced my mother that she needed to call the FBI because they were plotting something. My mom's cousin developed it next and now that cousin's daughter has it. I'm 25 now, female, and have been worried my whole life about this, but your post helped me realize that just because members of my family ended up with schizophrenia doesn't mean I will develop it and if I do develop symptoms, they might not affect my life  enough to be diagnosed.Thank you so much! I have severe depression and i sit here crying because you just gave me courage to continue to deal with it my way. There's so much pressure just to take the meds and shut up, but for me, they can only be the last ressort.THANK YOU for this.  One symptom doesn't make a diagnosis.  A lifetime of coping with symptoms eventually caused breakdowns that required treatment.  Being able to manage your own symptoms is a blessing until it isn't. Thank you for this post!  I think this applies to a lot of other disorders as well.  Most disorders are on a spectrum, people may think they have OCD or bipolar disorder, etc. because they relate to certain symptoms some of the time, but no human is free from the original natural behaviors that are called disordered when they become more amplified, distorted, and consistent in a way that affects the ability to function day to day.  Great post. Fully agree! Although I think having a diagnosis, even without treatment, and having people close to + your GP know about it is a good thing. Some people are "stable" schizophrenics, some have lapses, or ups and downs, some get worse over time, and even a few get better over time. Awareness I think is a key part in "treating" schizophrenia, much more so than antipsychotics. 
 Thank you for this. I don’t know anyone with schizophrenia or symptoms of it, but this has given me enough information to know how I can /somehow/ be of help to anyone who may need it. To add: psychosis symptoms occur in variance across the population. (Source: research psychologist)Thank youThanks for posting, this is all fascinating insight!> First, it is absolutely possible to be high-functioning with schizophrenia in the same way it's possible to be high-functioning with depression or an eating disorder or any kind of mental illness. If you can go to school or work, maintain normal relationships, take care of your daily tasks (eating, showering, errands, etc), then you don't really need treatment. There are actually a surprising amount of high-functioning schizophrenics. However, many of us will claim to have depression or anxiety when asked about it because the stereotype of schizophrenia is this horror-movie trope where you're babbling in a corner by yourself. Just look at the responses to you in this thread telling you to rush to a doctor immediately and consider medication. Many people simply don't understand that you can have schizophrenia and look and work and live just like everyone else.

So you can have schizophrenia and be a mostly-functional adult with a proper life, etc? 

> Second, mental disorders are called disorders because they cause disorder in your life. You can have a symptom or two without having a full-blown disorder. Diagnosis for psychiatric disorders actually hinges on whether it affects your life. In the DSM-5, a schizophrenia diagnosis requires "For a significant portion of the time since the onset of the disturbance, one or more major areas of functioning such as work, interpersonal relations, or self-care, are markedly below the level achieved prior to the onset." Contrary to popular belief, having a hallucination doesn't mean that you immediately need anti-psychotics. And, it's completely possible to have daily hallucinations yet not receive a schizophrenia diagnosis because the hallucinations don't interfere with the rest of your life.

Wait, so now you can't have schizophrenia unless it materially impacts your life? 

I'm not seeing how it's possible to catch a diagnosis and be high functioning. The two appear incompatible. Thank you for talking about this. This is so important.Ok, but I feel like "high functioning schizoprenia" is not really schizoprenia. Actually, I think most of the posts on here are just bullshit. I know somebody who has schizoprenia and I'm around him a lot, and I don't think he would be capable of talking about it on reddit. I think reddit is confusing the terms psychosis, and full-blown schizophrenia. A person with schizoprenia has psychosis, forever; but even a normal and mentally healthy individual can experience occasional psychosis

1. He is aware he has a problem, but doesn't really understand/know its schizophrenia. Someone with true schizophrenia really cannot logically be self-aware of having schizophrenia 

2. He is mostly "functional" i.e., can drive, go to the gym, get lunch, but it takes just one look at him to realize somethings not right and he needs hours/days of mental preparation before doing any minor task, even showering. He certainly wouldn't be able to make many coherent reddit comments, and even if he could, he wouldn't want to.

3. If he doesn't take the medicine; he will become very unstable/emotional/sad/depressed/hear voices etc.. if he takes the medicine, he becomes very emotionless, zombie-like, not talkative, etc.

Now, I assume everyone with schizoprenia is slightly different and everyone has varying degrees of the disease, but I don't believe someone who actually hears voices without heavy medication on a daily basis would be able to post on reddit about their experienceI wonder if this is why my mother in law says she can see angels and demons, and even talk to them. Outside of this she seems pretty normal.You are a fine person and your words are beyond gold.

I have family members that struggle with schizophrenia, and they're both fully functional members of society that most wouldn't know have the illness unless they were told.

From what I understand, for my relatives, it's the side effects of the medication that are the toughest.  Tardive dyskinesia sucks.  :(Do you hear the sounds mostly when you are really tired? I hear a bunch  of people rambling in my head , but only when I'm really tired. None of the rambling makes makes sense it sounds like jibberish. My family has a history of mental illness. My dad has bi-polar/depression. I was told that his father did too, though he was never formally diagnosed with mental illness.I have a question, when I was younger (4-10) I'd always hear people calling out my name, or 'talking' to me inside my head - the talking would be the worst, think about the most boring conversation ever held in the most auto-tone voice for hours on end and there was nothing I could do to shut it up.

These both stopped on their own, I want to say around age 12, but sometimes the voices would peak up, no where near as long or as loud but if I focus on them they become center of attention. My question is; my grandmother had documented schizophrenia but as far as we know, her kids (my father included) don't follow her on this path (there is the sneaking suspicion though that my brother*s* autism is fed through my fathers genetics but that's another story for another day)

Should I be concerned at all? Its all been a fleeting thought of mine that I do have some sort of mental illness purely as I was the break in the chain for my family and was the first 'normal' child. As far as I know I've never been tested for it, and other than a test or two when I was a baby for autism, never really been tested for anything mental health related.

The main thing that's causing me concern is the withdrawing from the world comment you made in the last paragraph; I find that if I hit a bump in the road it turns into a fit of 'Me against the world' and can carry on like that anywhere from a week to months at a time. I struggle to deal with emotions in a rational and 'normal' way and rather than work through emotional issues I much sooner 'shut off' my emotions and turn into 'Blank me', nothing will faze me, nothing will excite me, nothing will rise a natural, genuine reaction; it all becomes fake emotions and reactions based off what the crowd is feeling. 

Should I be concerned at all? Its been like this my whole lifeThank you for this post, my friend. You have bolstered and strengthened my stance on this. 

I would be willing to bet good money that I should be diagnosed as schizophrenic. I exhibit many distinct symptoms, the likes of which shall remain omitted from this writing for it not lending any appropriate significance. 

  However, I don't feel the need, or rather I much prefer not to see a professional to give me a label. 
I am who I am, and find that the lack of a diagnosis leaves me a much better person. If I were to be labelled with something, it would manifest stronger in my mind and be harder to incorporate as simply a natural part of me. I would feel deeply uncomfortable; it would feel like a problem suddenly. I've always been a little bit "eccentric" or whatever, but that's what makes me human, not dull, different. 
I prefer to consider each trait, each symptom as just one part of the multi-faceted patchwork comprising the impossibly complex human psyche and that's just beautiful.How do you recommend a post for /r/bestof?Schizophrenia diagnosis also requires experiencing symptoms for "one month and the duration of total disturbance must be six or more months. The diagnosis cannot be made on the basis of negative symptoms or gross disorganized behavior...the patient must present with at least one positive symptom such as hallucinations, delusions, or disorganized thinking."Thank you so much for this.  I don't have schizophrenia but it is SO IMPORTANT that we all begin removing the fear and stigma of mental illness and mental disorders in general.  I learned something here and I hope others did too.This is an amazing post. I work in mental health and this is such a validating and valuable piece of information to have out there. Thank you for sharing this!Very helpful post, man! Thank you for this!Im my sisters caregiver and she is scitzoaffective. All of your comment are hugely helpful. Thank you. We really appreciate the insight because low income clinics don't help hardly at all, you have to do the legwork or youre wasting your time. Thanks againYou deserve the gold you got.

I've got an 8yo who is diagnosed ADHD but I'm seriously starting to consider schizophrenia in some form - he had an episode on the weekend where he swore black and blue someone was outside watching him and his sister play. He does have a tendency to lie/ embellish the truth but he was so upset about it I actually locked the doors and sent my partner out to check.

He often speaks about animal growls/ eyes etc.

This post gives me hope that regardless of any diagnosis and associated stigma attached anyone can have a wonderful, functioning life.As someone writing a book about someone with high-functioning schizophrenia, this has been a big help. I've come a long way from thinking of him as a neckbeard "chad-wannabe" on drugs to a relatively normal kid.

Something important I recently realized was how helpful it would be to start the book off with the narrator on medication, to separate his personality from the disorder. deserve gold !!>  Just look at the responses to you in this thread telling you to rush to a doctor immediately and consider medication. 

Most of your post it correct, but as a psychologist, I'd be careful with statements like that. First, because we don't know as much about schizophrenia as we would like to. There are some indications that it may get worse over time, so you'd want to have meds with you just in case. Second, because of confirmation bias. You're giving people who are scared of finding out they are schizophrenic hope that they may not need medical attention, which can be pretty bad down the line.

If you think you have a mental disorder, go to a mental health professional, research your treatment options and make a conscious decision along with your doctor about your possible treatment.I am bipolar and MANY others and I completely agree. I work with the public (Retail) And usually keep my bipolar to myself because I get sick of the mass murder/psychotic break stereotype. Yes, I have a knife collection. BUT because of my OCD I'd more likely let my ass get kicked than use one on a person because that would require sanitizing my knives. I can't stand guns so I'd never buy one and shoot up a place. My OCD I use to my advantage. I am obsessed with organization rather than cleaning. I am 99.9% of the time working truck day because I get my section done fast. My boss knows that if she lets me do my method (I work HBA, A lot of stuff in my section come in totes, But the aisles are always combined in the totes. I always spend a few minutes, organize the totes so that each tote is its own section, then get to work) I am really good at numbers so I am a fast stocker, and I am generally organized. My boss knows of my mental illnesses and accommodates them as best she can. I once asked why I was hired. Her exact response was "My attention to detail"

I grew up being told I was a "Problem" and psychotic and such and had a terrible childhood. Recently found out I have Reactive attachment disorder. I have recently begun embracing my disorder and trying to show that I am NOT psychotic (95% of the time XD) I have a bachelor's degree in Psychology and am going for my masters in Forensic psychology. My goal is to help teenagers so they do not have a miserable adult life. My life could be SOOO much worse right now. 

Statistically, I should be a drug addict, criminal, drunk, dead, homeless or any of the combination above. Instead, I am the opposite and only by my own strength. I want to help teens get the strength to succeed out of terrible situations and not go down the rabbit hole of crime and addiction. I already help people to the best of my ability, my own personal experiences help me give generally good advice.

Thank you so much for spreading the truth about mental illness, and I say the same... if anyone has questions about mental illness, I will answer as truthfully as I can, I know about a lot, because I have a lot and my favorite subject in psychology to study is mental illness.I guess things like the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia) for schizophrenia don't help. It literally starts with *Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by abnormal social behavior and failure to understand what is real.* It seems to me like you can maintain normal social behavior and have a good idea of what is real and what is a hallucination. No wonder people assume it always means the "babbling in a corner" stereotype.But would it really be schizophrenia? It’s been going on for years and I just accept it.And most think what happened to them is ‘ normal happens to everyone ‘ I’m finding this thread actually fascinating and terrifying Right? Dang...We're all mad here.So many people who don’t realize hearing your name in a crowd or random noises or shadows in the corner of your vision are not signs of schizophrenia...A lot of people hear people calling their names. That would freak the fuck out of me. It’s scaring the shit out of me. The topmost chain of comments right now all read as though they could be written by the same person on different accounts or something (or maybe that’s just me) and it is freaking me out big time for some reason.Psychosis is definitely not unique to schizophrenia though. So many self diagnosed schizophrenics in this thread too. I've heard it's hard to get a diagnosis. It takes like 6 months of visits to the doctor and if you don't report symptoms just once then you aren't diagnosed

I could be wrong tho. I don't know about that. Psychosis is a symptom of other mental illness.Some of its not neccesarily schizophrenia, as far as I'm aware there are a handful of forms of schizophrenia, and hallucinations alone aren't enough to actually be schizophrenic.  You generally need to be disjointed, nonresponsive, or delusional also.  

(Delusions and hallucinations are two different, commonly overlapping phenomena.  Hallucinations are a false stimuli while delusions are a false belief).  What if it's not cameras, but just that I feel there is some being constantly watching me? I get paranoid a lot that people can hear my thoughts. 

When I was younger I used to hide in my dark closet to change because I didn't want whoever to see me. It's not as bad now, because I just don't give a shit who sees me. Holy crap! You were really close to the breaking point. How long did you sleep for when you finally feel asleep? 

I drove 18 hrs straight to get to my wife. 
Which isn't bad, but the night before I prolly had about 4 hours asleep and didn't end up starting the journey till 2 pm. So basically all night driving, 
which is daunting. About 10hrs in i started seeing like a swarm of birds that just loomed right outside my headlights view and occasionally would swoop down at my window. It was unnerving, but I knew I was cracking when i started seeing shadow people walking across an interstate not caring about the cars. It was about the time it looked like I run over someone, I pulled off and sleep for awhile. Weird what your mind will do if you take away something it needs. 

For the people that have schizophrenia, 
You guys and girls are special, not crazy. 
I appreciate those who are willing to share so people can better understand each unique situation.
Thank you

lol what the fuck. When was this? I can't imagine a university doing that ~these days~, it sounds incredibly unsafe.How long did you sleep for afterwards?I would've never realised how true this is if I hadn't dropped acid. It did feel like I was losing my mind but I did know it wasn't real--a privilege that I assume people with certain types of mental illnesses don't have.Don’t even need drugs to see shadow people. Or serious sleep deprivation. Sometimes the mind just plays tricks on you if you’re daydreaming or trying to fall asleep. I've known people who thought they were being haunted because they thought they could hear voices or a radio on in another room at night. I've helped exorcise these ghosts for them by asking them to turn off any fans or air conditioners they have on at night to see if it makes a difference. I know when a fan is on I've often felt I could hear actual music playing with specific notes and instruments, all just from my brain trying to interpret the white noise.It did. That I did not just accept. Oh no, I realize it isn’t normal, but it doesn’t bother me. It’s like the tv is on a low volume and you can’t tell what it’s saying. It’s also not 100 percent of the time. Very few times have I heard it get loud enough to make out what’s been said.Yeah this is common I think, I used to hear someone shouting for me when I used the hair dryer or the vacuum. I'd turn it off and shout "yeah?" and they'd be like, "we weren't calling you."

Vacuum and hairdryer have the same kind of staticy droning sound, it doesn't happy with anything else.Holy shit, I totally hear the Pokémon noises sometimes, particularly if I’m high. Weird. When I was younger and did a little of psychedelics I used to turn my radio on to a blank station and just listen to the white noise to try to induce auditory hallucinations and it was incredibly effective, sometimes I could even hear very shockingly real things when I would do it when completely sober. It's really a strange feeling, you know it's not real yet it's still happening, much like an optical illusion only for the ears. For the most part everything I heard seemed very musical, but sometimes when I would really space out and do it for a while I would hear things that really disturbed me, for reasons I can't exactly explain. Lots of voices and sounds that just for whatever reason caused a great feeling of fear or very detailed negative thoughts. It's such a fascinating thing to see where your mind goes when its given the chance to wanderThis reminds me of the "Phantom Ice Cream Truck" lots of people reported hearing at a camp ground in the middle of the mountains I used to work summers at.

It was an old mining area, so ghost sitings were a generally accepted possibility, but there was just no way an ice cream truck had ever made its way anywhere near the camp, so we all chalked it up to this exact phenomenon - kids visiting from more urban areas weren't used to the background noise, but since it was summer they *were* accustomed to hearing an ice cream truck, so people's brains just filled it in from the confusing sensory information they were getting.

The brain is such an interesting tool...like, half of our perception is actually intuition.

Edit: to pre-abate any odd theories about how an ice cream truck ghost *could* have got up to the campsite, at one point I took it upon myself to ask people what the truck *sounded* like whenever they reported it, and the melodies varied widely...but everyone agreed it sounded like their *own* particular local truck at home.In the shower, I often seem to hear either music or mumbling, but it's the acoustics of the water bouncing off the tile (it's a shower stall completely enclosed in tile with a metal/glass door.)

Luckily no voices! I'd hate for my intrusive thoughts to be audible.I nearly shat myself reading your comment just now, because of the familiarity. I have bipolar with psychosis, and in the most stressful moments of my life, I've heard the Pokemon R/B/Y and G/S/C soundtracks! It's wild. It happens faintly sometimes when I've had a busy day, but when I'm really stressed, it's like there's a radio stuck inside my head and playing freaking Route 30 or the Mt. Moon theme.[deleted]I hear ringing a lot. Like one time in high school I walked out of class because I swore I heard the bell ring. My whole class followed me (we were lining up for lunch anyway) and I only realized what I did because my best friend asked me why I just walked out like that. Then the bell rang for real. 

I've always assumed this was just some sort of ear/hearing problem. Yeah, this happens to me when I’m scuba diving! It’s the sounds of my breathing but sometimes I hear it as music or my friend calling me. It only really happens when there’s nothing exciting to see though. I hear those, too, usually when in the shower or something. Nothing to be troubled by. The brain is always trying to connect things, even when not necessary. It sure as hell is powerful, but not nearly perfect. Hmmm. My children sleep with a noise machine in their rooms. I’m beginning to wonder if this could have a negative long-term affect on them? 

I personally sleep better with white noise or I will hyper-focus on every sound I hear. When I am very tired and about to fall asleep, I become more jumpy. A car driving by sounds too close to the house or the dog barking in the distance must be someone trying to break into houses, etc. I don’t use it anymore because I hate feeling like I can’t hear my kids calling for me if they really need me in the night and I trick myself into thinking I hear them crying or calling out for me even when they’re not. I’ve concluded that I’ll be sleep deprived until they turn 30, anyway. 

But just in case, I’m going to look online and see if there have been any studies on long-term use of noise machines.Sometimes I'll hear someone call my name when it wasn't anyone. Something I remember vividly when I was about 7 or 8 was walking home from school late one day, no parents were picking up any kids, but I swear to god, I heard someone call my name out. Looked around and there wasn't anyone.

I also see shadow people like OP was describing when I drive, which freaks me out a bit because I always want to hit the brakes, but stop myself when I realize no one's actually there. It happens a lot during my morning drive to work, less so afterwards.that only happens to me (the 8bit noise kaleidoscope) when on really good acid so, uh...I hear music in white noise. Usually it sounds like a radio. I can rarely actually pick out a melody, but I can get enough to identify a genre (country, oldies, jazz, etc.). I am bipolar, and have been diagnosed with various other things over the years. But this is the one thing, that for some reason they all acted like I had some sort of psychosis. They all said they had "never heard of that before." I'm glad I can hear someone else not only experiencing this phenomenon, but giving it a very plausible cause. Thanks.[RadioLab](http://www.radiolab.org/story/91792-hallucinating-sound/) actually did an episode about musical hallucinations held by people with hearing loss. It was absolutely fascinating. Basically, the brain does not like quiet, and the nerves that hear, and send sound to the brain, can go backwards!Hey yeah, when I sleep with a fan on at night the fan sometimes sounds like a radio playing musicThis really trips me the fuck out!  I audibly what the fuck?!ed when I read this comment. I've never told *anyone* this, but sometimes when I lie down to go to sleep and the whole house is quiet, I can hear the battle music from the old Pokemon games. Sometimes it's other songs like the ones for Pewter City or Mt. Moon, but it's mostly the song that plays during battle. That's been going on since I first started playing Red, when I was like.. 7 years old. I **never** thought I'd meet someone else who would have a similar issue, if you could call it that. This has been a strange mind fuck.This is a super interesting concept, and seems to be the brain amazingly recreating the noises it expects to hear in those times of silence. I'm entirely unable to recreate or imagine sounds (or images/smells/tastes etc - if you're  interested, search for aphantasia), so I wonder if this lack of auditory imagination allows the brain to make sense of white noise? Though I doubt I've ever been in a completely silent  environment so tricky to tell.My old bathroom fan used to play the best heavy metal. Just fuckin ripped epic songs. This makes sense to me. Schizophrenia as one discrete classification of brain states where sensory pattern-recognition is over-sensitive.

Particularly with the emerging science of fooling computer-based recognition systems, I wonder if it would be possible to create sensory filters that adjust the "contrast" and so the recognition thresholds.

Has anyone with schizophrenia found that audio hallucinations decreased when wearing a hearing aid (which have band-pass filters to selectively amplify different frequencies)?I'd once played CSGO for a solid 8 hours straight and then went to bed and I shit you not I heard an awp firing as if it was right behind me, only time ive ever had  an auditory hallucination like that but odd none the less.Why are you giving that guy excuses not to get help? If he's alone and he can hear "Satan breathing," it's probably not a white noise situation. Thank you for sharing this, your situation is almost identical to mine and it's nice to see I'm not alone xxWhen I get stressed I get Exploding Head Syndrome. 

Let me tell you thats was a hell of a surprise the first time it happened. Thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you. I experienced a series of auditory hallucinations in my childhood and teen years, probably related to stress from my family moving at the same time as other major life changes. I was only ever diagnosed with childhood bipolar. Always kind of wondered whether I was some kind of dormant/un-diagnosed schizophrenic. I am so relieved to hear that it can be a side affect of other mental illnesses/stress. I have BPD, MDD, and anxiety, and I've experienced bouts of mild psychosis. Sometimes it's stress-induced and sometimes it's also related to a bad meds reaction. When I went on an antipsychotic for a while, I wound up gaining 70 pounds in the span of a few months. I wish that my psychiatrist would have taken more time to seriously consider all of the options before making the choice for medication. I'm not saying meds are bad, just not something to fuck around with.Same with MD & Anxiety, I sometimes hear what sounds like a deep mans voice but cant make out any words. I also am currently trying to get over an irrational fear that someone has bugged the house or aomeone is watching me thru the xbox. Many other disorders can have psychotic features, including hallucinations. With regards to depression and anxiety, there are often persistent and recurrent deluded or distorted thoughts. Delusions, while not hallucinations, still qualify as psychotic and have the same negative impact as hallucinations with regards to one's functionality This. I have this and it sucksMaybe that's the difference. Anxiety can be so insane that it might appear to be something else. I'm reading all these comments and I'm like oh shit I'm more crazy then I thought... I think it's just intense anxiety for a lot of people here. Thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you. I experienced a series of auditory hallucinations in my childhood and teen years, probably related to stress from my family moving at the same time as other major life changes. I was only ever diagnosed with childhood bipolar. Always kind of wondered whether I was some kind of dormant/un-diagnosed schizophrenic. I am so relieved to hear that it can be a side affect of other mental illnesses/stress. I had some very distressing experiences and was sure I had schizophrenia until I received a formal diagnosis of psychotic depression (which I didn't even know was a thing). I wound up on some fairly strong anti psychotics for a while (among other things) and also learned that I'm not supposed to do unguided meditation/mindfulness (apparently nobody with psychotic symptoms is supposed to) but thankfully now I'm med free and doing so much better and only get hypagnotic hallucinations when I'm tired (which anyone can get).I had a period of about a year and a half where I would hear nonsensical conversations in my head, with different voices.  Or just a string of nonsense sentences said by one person, like "The cat's playdoh will instigate lunar paper trails across the shower door."  Usually only happened when I was trying to fall asleep, or when I was in a situation where I was alone and just trying to do something not very mentally stimulating.

Then they slowed down for a month, then stopped completely.  Looking back I think it was my subconscious trying to tell me that I was under a lot more stress than I thought I was, because I was trying to work a lot in order to move out, and at the same time had pretty bad insomnia and couldn't fall asleep for hours and would wake up multiple times during the night as well.  When I lowered my stress level the voices went away.

I kind of miss them actually, since they were so bizarre I found them entertaining.  They never once suggested violence; it was always weird nonsense that could have come from Monty Python or something.So sometimes hearing people whisper my name while at work might be from the stress of my crappy job?I think this is almost identical to my experience. I was previously treated for depression and still suffer from anxiety. It's better these days, but I used to get into prolonged states of extreme anxiety (multiple consecutive days) which disrupted my sleep patterns. This triggered auditory hallucinations and full-blown epileptic seizures.  
  
In my case, although the hallucinations were vivid and freaked me the hell out, I could still clearly differentiate between hallucinations and reality, though. If you have ever had a lucid dream, the feeling is pretty much the same. Is this at all similar to your experience?  
  
I have no idea whether this is the reality (and maybe someone with experience can comment), but I have always imagined that true schizophrenics lack the ability to distinguish between hallucination and reality "intuitively".I also have major depression and anxiety and I find in times of high stress and insomnia I experience exploding head which is a fancy way of saying loud auditory hallucinations. Like I'll often be jolted from a nap hearing explosions, bangs, sirens, screams. It's so startling and makes it harder to fall back asleep. Hallucinations can be the mind jumping to conclusions when trying to cope and analyse things. Points when overloaded by stress or emotional upset can cause audio and or visual hallucinations especially in those with mental health issues.

I suffer from hallucinations on a semi regular basis due to my ASD. Usually it's nothing more than an odd noise or the walls moving like they're breathing when I'm upset or anxious. Occasionally thinking I'm seeing a shape of someone. Only once when very young and immensely distressed did I have a full blown watching things come to life on the walls and start moving. 

I didn't dare tell doctors about it when going for depression and anxiety but raised it during an assessment with a Tertiary Health Team and they informed me it was actually part of ASD. I'm the same I have bipolar I and bpd and I get hallucinations when I am stressed, anxious, or manic.I get them with my migraines, they started when the migraines became more serious and were really frequent. Now it only happens rarely. Turns out there are lots of things that can trip the auditory centers of the brain. Mania related to bipolar has it as well

Source: Am bipolar and experienced it a few times.Aren't they expected side effects of antianxiety and antidepressant medications?It happens to some people. Minor auditory hallucinations are not super uncommon.Really? I hear noises quite frequently. I often can hear music/songs I know, as well as people yelling my name but muffled. I always assumed it was normal. I guess it doesn’t really help that I quite frequently see things walking passed me out of my peripherals. I’ve always just assumed it’s a symptom of my lovely add, depression, anxiety mix lolWait that doesnt? I hear sounds but not voices, I'll hear things that nobody else hears and I was diagnosed with adhd, and then diagnosed with asbergers. Does that mean I need to talk to a doctor about that?Yeah, for real.Ever feel your phone vibrate on your person, and it didn't?Everyone's mental health would be a lot better if we didnt stigmatize mental disorders and look down on people who seek help. Even normal people need help and advice from time to time, just to process normal problems like anxiety, stress, ptsd, loss, guilt, you name it. But we all have this stupid idea in our heads that we always have to do things alone and that we're weak for seeking the help of a therapist. Many people would rather just burn out or go crazy than have to admit that they need help. You dont have to hit rock bottom just to see a therapist. All you need is curiosity and concerns.Yeah, weird things can happen to your senses when you're asleep, or falling asleep. I often hear random noises when I'm lying in bed, or sometimes even conversations between people who aren't there. I never hear those things when I'm not in bed though.Worst part is, she's been dead for years.

Also it wasn't a cat. Haha. Sleep is for the weak. I don’t sleep in the week.
No but seriously, I don’t sleep great. 😒Yeah, it never caused any real problems beyond "I definitely absolutely should not drive late at night when I'm tired".Do I just outright tell them I’m hearing. If I do that I’m not going to get instantly 72’d am I?

Know of any ways that could mellow them out in the meantime?Yeah me too. Since I was 13 I've had a deep fear of developing schizophrenia and have obsessed about it periodically. This thread is freaking me out.Yeah I expect that's the case.Yeah I don't expect it to be anything, just a bit unnerving when reading this thread haha.I've actually had my hypnagogic hallucinations keep me *awake* a few times. Have to actually get out of bed and do something else for a while to shake them off before trying to go back to sleep. Luckily I've become much better at both getting enough sleep and dealing with stress so I haven't had them in years (or maybe I just grew out of them)Oh interesting. I had one of these a couple weekends ago. Got extremely tired and anxious in the early evening and as I was trying to pass out, I distinctly heard a wispy woman's voice telling me to "go write it down". I'm not sure what I wanted myself to write, but that was an odd hallucination.I don't know, the neighbours, or the TV downstairs, or something. Tbh I've always had this. As soon as I do sth "embarrassing" while alone, I get paranoid about people knowing or seeing it. It's not really cameras, it's more like some all knowing thing or idk. Isn't that normal to some extent? I don't have a point of reference, I don't know how others think. Ah, like my semi-annual "see if I've developed psychic powers or attuned to the Force" test. Total nonsense, but it would suck to find out on my death bed that I had powers the whole time and never knew.Help is expensive. I am fully funtioning with a family. Its not severe, If it begins really effecting my life I will seek help. I hatr medication and I do not want to be drugged up, or play musical medication until we find one that sucks less than the others. Interesting, thanks. I wasn’t concerned until I opened this thread! (Okay a little. I have a genetic predisposition to it but no one I know is diagnosed so that’s a plus. But I only know one side of my genes.) 

I will keep an eye on it and maybe mention it to my psychiatrist if it persists though! This isn't fucking /r/nosleep and no they're not. You saw shadows, not shadow people, or were both tired and saw one of the most common hallucinations humans experience.I sincerely wish you the best . Life is tough without this on top you are clearly strong Ok I was curious because my sister has a lot of these symptoms as well. She also always tells us people follow her because they are mad at her and they copy her. She just started taking medicine again for the first like in 6 years.  Hopefully this helps her some as well. Hope you continue to do well and improve!Holy fuck that made my skin crawl.Yeah the hair thing is weird little fantasy coming from a guy with next to no imagination, and I worry generally that the whole routine is a becoming a compulsive ritual.

I had bad haircuts as a kid and now I absolutely love cutting my own hair: male, nothing fancy and I'm good enough to save myself money without it looking poor. But it's becoming a little compulsive, like I notice myself trimming any little hairs sticking up, usually after a shower but sometimes just when I'm stressed or procrastinating. 

Idk... the story probably doesn't end well.yeah I've always chalked it up to being tired too, but now I'm 21 and i can't feel like i can trust anyone. its hard to say if it's because i was recently stolen from by my best friend then betrayed by the person i told what happened, or if there's something else. wow NiceIt's been years since I saw that movie. I wonder how old that girl is nowWell putoh my, I want to see this, written by /u/thesoundandthefuryI wanted to ask if any of the schizophrenics had ever mistaken a real person for a hallucination, I guess it was obvious they must. I had a lucid dream once where I told a friend that actually I wasn't there, I was on my bed, sleeping, and that was a dream of mine (and so she was, and we were possibly sharing that dream). She just chuckled and said 'really?'*hits blunt*That sucks. Hope things with them turn around and they become more open and accepting. I love all the experiments, they're awesomeWell, he suddenly became a lot less pleasant...Damn... Sounds scary man... Thanks for reply!I have those too. When I am super tired I can hear my mom talking to me about random stuff. But it is not like I imagine or remember her voice but instead I hear her. She lives 6000 miles away from me lol. 

Some other times I hear a man with a very deep voice. Both of them are Not threatening but I thought that I was developing schizophrenia since I have a uncle who has it. 


I miss my mom :(Oh man, I guess that's what was happening to me as a kid. I always have trouble sleeping, even back then, so I'd often find myself in that weird transitional period between awake and asleep, never quite making it, and my brain would always conjure up the same illusion of a big, fat, hairy spider descending down on my bedsheets, or crawling across my curtains. I'd always instantly 'wake up' slapping the thing away, obsessively turning over my sheets back and forth to see where it went.

I used to have a huge fear of spiders and it was right around that time when the myth of "you eat 7 spiders in your sleep during your life time" was at an all time high, so that probably contributed to it too.I have Narcolepsy and experience these daily/nightly. At first I thought it was Schizophrenia as it runs heavily on both sides of my family. "Lucky" to only have Narcolepsy, I suppose. can you grab his ghost chips?That really funny! My wife can tell when a swing is about to happen so she just grand my hand and does a lot of the talking for me if we are in public. A lot of times people won't notice unless I start crying randomly.Good to know!There you goWoah.  Thank you for the explanation.  I hope the best for you in dealing with this incredibly difficult condition.I wrote a [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12tGlz7-lD2f0E-kVWcyl52vxsz3Qpv2WEJKg--C5tJg/view) a few months ago that should answer that question at least a little.Not this guy but this is schizophrenia as portrayed in movies like A Beautiful Mind. It’s not real schizophrenia. I’m no expert but I’ve had a clinical rotation in a psychiatric hospital. Real schizophrenia does not have concrete visual hallucinations like this. They’re also not consistent. They’re more like flares of light. The closest thing I’ve ever heard of this is someone seeing dead bodies. We actually watched A Beautiful Mind in class to discuss how it’s a misrepresentation of schizophrenia in this way. If this guy walked into a psych facility for an assessment and described his symptoms as he did in his OP, he would be considered malingering, not schizophrenic.What did he say?Yeah, I'm sorry.  I can only imagine what it's like to have schizophrenia.   I regularly work with people with schizophrenia and I have so much admiration for how strong and enduring they often are (and have to be).I'm not sure what I was expecting, but it wasn't that.Not to be insensitive, but that could be a brilliant screenplay if handled right. Lead the viewers to believe that the protagonist can read the minds of the people in his life, but with a twist ending, the protagonist is actually schizophrenic.Wow, that must have been really difficult to cope with, especially if you heard mean voices.So, how did you feel when you figured out it was all in your head?I thought everyone could read my mind, that everyone else was robots. Aspergers doh. I'm confused. Can I pm you later?God damn.  Talk about a let down once you realized it was schizophrenia.  Same. Now I'm twenty and half assed diagnosed with Borderline. I have a LOT of paranoid ideation and "voices" that make it hard to think constantly. I dont know what in the world is wrong with my head but "affordable" healthcare is half of my income :(That's an interesting thought... it makes me think: what if someone was really uncommonly intuitive and had a similar issue. So they had a sense of what others were thinking and also heard it in their voice. How distinguishable would that be from actual mind reading? Does the distinction matter? Could this account for some ESP claims?I had a shower thought about that a while agoDoes this mean I have schizophrenia. As a child, I would oft wake up to screaming voices in my head in the middle of the night telling me I was going to burn in hell. The voice was always demonic. (probably something to do with being active in church as a child) I also used to feel like an invisible thing was watching me sleep from the same corner of my room every night and when I woke up in the morning three shadow figures shoulder to shoulder would slowly come towards me and then disappear after a few seconds. Fuck it while I'm rambling, A lot of my childhood dreams would involve running away from people who wanted to decapitate me, sometimes people covered in blood, a lot of decapitated heads and mind you This all went on until I was about 13. 19 now.I was also a mind reader Wow I never really told anyone but when I was little I heard randomly people’s voices say things like HEY!, hey?, and hey. All of them were greetings. Whenever it happened I would actually be startled. People thought I was just jumpy or something. I would soon after try to reply but to no avail. My method of trying to reply was weird. I would pretend there was a keyboard in front of me and I would type my response and hit enter. Childhood auditory hallucinations are not a predictor of schizophrenia, says a google search I did about this last week.

For me, those childhood voices stopped after my first loud concert around age 11A lot of schizophrenics think that. They also think people are reading their mind. I'm sure you knew that but neurodivergence really intrigues meYes. This is a thing. My dad would tell me about conversations he had "overheard" and things I had said to him that never happened. This is a torture technique used in a book called THE RUINS. Carnivorous plants emit fumes that cause stranded tourists to audibly hallucinate cell phones ringing, hear their loved ones banging their friends, etc.Happened to me with a friend who I didn't know was prone to "psychotic breaks" according to their family. I called one morning about 9 a.m., she said she couldn't meet me for lunch, was meeting Mary. Otherwise normal conversation.

Spoke with her the same day at 3 p.m. she said she just woke up and said it was because she was up all night with the police because someone tried to break into her place and she didn't get to bed until 10 a.m. I was like, "Um really?  I thought you had a lunch appointment with Mary. Why wouldn't you mention something as big as that when I spoke to you at 9?" We had also texted which I had on my phone.

According to her, the conversation never happened. She then decided I was out to get her, I was working with the man who had been stalking her for years -- the guy who supposedly tried to break in the night before. I had hacked into her text messages and inserted text messages that we talked, she was convinced of it. She packed up her kid and left town when the landlord got pissed off that she called the cops again for no reason, for the third time in one week and the neighbors were complaining.

Obviously, something wasn't right. I found her sister in another state, who she had told me was seriously mentally ill and hospitalized. Turns out it was my friend with the problem. The family had been looking for her for two years to get the kid away from her because she refused to take anti-psychotic medication and would just go off the deep end. Sister told me she was relatively normal most of the time, but had some sort of paranoid fantasy from time to time that she was being stalked, watched, attacked, etc. and her daughter was going to be kidnapped.

Really fucked up stuff.There's also a chance she just became very sensitive and things that always bothered her a little became more prominent and she overreacted. Or you know, you're an insulting bully with a schizophrenic acquaintance. Sometimes, that's not due to voices, but just due to paranoid delusions. The brain can convince itself quite a few things.If the voices in your head are talking to the voices in her head you're probably in trouble.My friend accused me of hacking into his computer and phone, reading all his conversations and making fun of him with our group of friends It's more like she went into hyper analysis mode and started putting together all the times you probably bullied her and came to the conclusion, well you're bullying her.

Schizophrenia isn't exactly what you think it is.*differentiate betweenYeah, my oldest brother asked me when I️ was in high school why my friends and I️ were making fun of and laughing at him - something I️ am 100% certain never occurred. His suspicion of me grew and today is not helped by the fact I’ve had him committed twice now. He and those around him are still safe, so I️ don’t regret it. Paranoia is a symptom of schizophrenia so that could have been the reasonIt's unlikely that she started hearing voices that just happened to sound like your voice that just happened to be saying negative things. One of the misconceptions about schizophrenia is that schizophrenics make up things out of the blue. What's far more likely is that there is an external incident that is over-analyzed or misinterpreted.

For example, if you failed to pick her up from work, that could be construed as a malicious attack instead of a simple mistake. Making a casual joke at her expense (even if you joked in that manner before) could be interpreted as actual vitriol during times of increased paranoia.somewhat related: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture-bound_syndromeThat sounds like synesthesia. I think I might know what you mean. Sometimes when I am super tired and I'm laying in bed about to drift off I will hear someone (usually a voice I know) call out my name or say something. Sometimes it sounds like it's from another room and other times right in front of me. I usually jump up but quickly realize it was in my mind because I'm so tired but I have been known to get up and ask someone if they called for me only for them to tell me no. That's a good description.My dad was the same way.Now-memoriesDoes treatment help you guys ?No disrespect but dude that's really creepy. You're a trooper for coping with thatI might need to see someone then. I get stuff like that all the timeI can do this too, they aren’t violent or telling me horrible things though. Could it still be a sign of something?This is the best way to put it!

I don't feel like it's audible, but it feels like an immediate memory.Can someone hear these things without being diagnosed?   Over the past few years I hear things like you've mentioned.  Voices (not like I'm having a conversation but almost like a memory of something, but certainly audible), dog barking, washing machine (or something mechanical running).  I've just always assumed it's because I was tired and needed rest.   

Edit - I guess what I'm asking is can the mind dream while awake?  That's what the sounds are like to me, a vivid dream.   That sounds like the "now memories" in Stranger Things season 2It's nearly impossible to explain to someone that hasn't experienced it. I get that schizophrenic person might not be able to distinguish between real and “fake“ voices… But at some point, assuming that person still has some rational faculties, I would think they would learn that some voices are real, but these other ones saying horrible/crazy things are fake…

I’m not saying that wouldn’t immediately make it super easy to deal with, and I think you speak to this a bit in your response above. If the problem is bad enough, it doesn’t matter if they can distinguish, they still believe the fake voices have veracity. Am I on the mark?> many don't recognize the hallucinations as in their head until after diagnosis.

False! Many, if not most schizophrenics realize that aural hallucinations are hallucinations. However, that doesn't stop them from happening. The same is true for visual hallucinations. If you'd like to learn more about schizophrenia, you can read my comment history so you can avoid spreading misinformation.> interferes with their ability to distinguish between "internal" and "external" stimuli

That is the definition of psychosis.There can be literal voices as well as delusions. Depending on the situation one or both can be present. In this case I was hearing literal voices.I had an experience once where I was keenly aware the things I was perceiving weren't real, but the reality seemed so ambiguous that I couldn't fully convince myself I was imagining it. People were talking to me, saying things that were meant to be taken at face value, but I was convinced there was a subtle sleight against me in everything they said. I wasn't mad or suspicious, but persistently apologetic. Schizophrenia is terrifying, and I don't know how people can deal with that all the time.Had a similar experience with benzos. The static in my head was overpowering. Shower and stay clean, palsAre they always the same voices? Nothing odd about their manner of speech? Accent? You feel the other voice's emotions as if they were your own? or kind of like as if it were someone with the emotions affecting you in some way. Like do you feel angry when the voices are angry or are you like scared because the voices are angry? 

Thanks for your responses dude. I feel so bad that this happens to you! I hope you're good, and that you're able to enjoy your life!Like with a real accordion? So now you can play? Any theories on how your brain subconsciously learned how to play according, or do you think the voice is an actual conciousness seperate from yours?You've said that one of the voices is good at math and another good at playing accordion. You also mentioned voices being linked with your brain trying to avoid cognitive dissonance. 

How good are those voices at certain things? Are they constantly learning as you do? Are they just barely better at things than you or are they way better than you? 

I'm fascinated by your occasionally helpful voices and wondering  if you actually could comprehend things like math way above your level with the help of your condition.

If you would happen to hear one of the helpful voices clearly during a test would it feel like cheating?I rap and sing! I'm on all major streaming services now. I take anti depressants and anxiety but idk sometimes I don't think they work. Music definitely helps me it saved my life after I stopped playing football Wow. That’s scary. I could imagine that being trigger points.Do you recognize them or are they strangers This whole thread is hitting close to home. Always thinking someone’s watching you etc, microphones in the vent. 

I always look up in public toilets and stare down the vents because I think someone is up there. Even now at home I can’t shake it. 

This is scary, am I schizophrenic? It never crossed my mind as a possibility.Yeah that's a whole thing. She has a severe alcohol addiction so I don't know. I also am not in contact with her (for about 9 years) so I don't know specifics. 
I'm glad you've found options you like! 
Thanks for your response! I guess I was more or less trying to get a handle on what it sounds like. Can you at least tell if it's a male or female voice?Now that sounds like a decent movie. Have you ever envisioned what some of them would look like? Things have gotten better. I have had a boyfriend this past year or two who has done wonders to help me feel safe, been accepting when I've had an episode/panic attack. And my particular situation specifically triggers a lot when it comes to people who are bigger/stronger than me (like my boyfriend), and sex. So naturally it's been rough!! But I'm doing better than I was doing a month ago, and that's a trend that goes a ways back. So I think I have found peace, at least on my good days. <3Hope you enjoy! Made me really think about how stigmas against mental illness are built up and how harmful they can be.Oh that’s cool! Ps I actually know you irl. We went to school together in 2011 and lived in the same dorms. I’m the red head guy. I’ve heard early-mid twenties is the usually timeframe. [removed]Yah, no jumper cables. I am disappointed[removed][removed]You think a 9 year old figured that out? That where the really good parenting shows. They preventively talked about mental issues obviously. Damn I'm jealous of those parents.I mean it's def anecdotal, but among my entire friend group I literally know of I think maybe 1? who has parents they'd describe as good. Good parents have never seemed the norm to me.I think they edited their post out by accident. It was relevant to the story.sounds like you have good parents.I don't know if you know, but you are so lucky for having parents that thought like that. The difference between 'If you don't feel right, you should see a doctor.' and 'There's something wrong with you and that's why you have to see a doctor' is huge.Thanks* for answering questions. Are the two, schizophrenia and ADHD, related?I wish my parents were like yours. My mother just said learning disorders don't exist and that was the end of that.You have very good parents. Therapy and psychiatric care were threats in my household. 

(I am very much reformed and have sought care from both since, when appropriate.)That's amazing - your parents are so mature. Mine scolded my sister, disciplined her, contradicted her and dismissed her until her symptoms escalated to the point where they could no longer deny that she had an illness... But of course the longer you leave it the worse it get so... She's likely chronically affected now 😐Still, dismissing babbling voices in the shower as "not really scary," at 9 or any other age, takes balls of steel.The year before, when you were diagnosed with ADHD, did they prescribe you Ritalin? 


I'm asking because one of the side effects of Ritalin is toxic psychosis which very well can be mistaken for a disorder such as schizophrenia. 


Adderal may also cause psychosis. 


Source: I'm a physician assistant and I just looked up potential adverse effects of common treatments for ADHD after reading your story. What ADHD medication were you on when you had your first Schizophrenic episode?Were you on meds for the ADHD?Yes, please do before you seriously harm yourself. Take care of your mind and body seriously, it’s for the best that you look into this sooner rather than laterJust out of curiosity, what differentiates thoughts of self harm associated with schizophrenia and the phenomenon know as the “call of the void.”  I’ve had several instances where I had a sudden urge to want to hurt myself, such as to draw a knife across the inside of my cheeks or to stick a fork in a power outlet, but without a real reason or desire to do so. I always just think it’s the “call of the void” and go about my day.  They happen very rarely, but I’m always surpirsed that I would even think of something like, especially since I have a large aversion to pain. 

I don’t in any way believe that I’m schizophrenic but I didn’t realize that people who are experienced voices telling to hurt themselves, and the way it has been described, sounds like something similar that I have personally experienced, albeit rarely. See its kind of weird, I have a "voice" in my head but I can control it, like when I read this comment the voice in my head read it, or for example when I think in words it says it in my head. Is this everyone?My great grandmother attacked a small boy on a bicycle before my family ever got a handle on her schizophernia. It is really important to take care of your mental health. Schizophrenics don't hurt people. They are just odd.From what I remember it's almost wholly genetic but iirc we don't know exactly what genes cause what symptoms. From what I remember of my highschool psych course (lol) people were basically coming to the conclusion that "schizophrenia" is actually a load of different genetic diseases that manifest with similar symptoms.There is definitely a genetic pre-disposition (the illness runs in families), and environmental triggers. But scientists have not yet nailed down the specifics of either.  The same goes for bipolar disorder.  Having a parent or sibling with the illness indicates you're more likely to develop it, but there are cases of identical twins in which one has the illness and one does not. 

There are a variety of potential triggers identified (stress, diet, marijuana use, etc), but there are always cases of people with a probable genetic pre-disposition who have experienced the given trigger, yet not become ill. Hello, there are a variety of responses in this thread such as "it's normal" to "seek help immediately". Im going to go with the seeking help. My college has a good mental health service and I'm currently involved in it for other reasons. It might as well be my inner voice telling me these things but I keep at what it tells me. If I haven't done what it tells me then I feel like I haven't accomplished a goal and makes me feel ashamed of myself. But yeah I will go see some professionals and probably ask my college for support. Thank you for your reply :)First off proably no idea what I am talking about

To me it doesn't sound like OCD but I know OCD can differ. It is just hard to think something call "the doubting disease" would involve being told you are perfect. Although does sound like intrusive thoughts

That said there a defitanly OCD voice people can hear (I do) , but I think there difference is that OCD it is an inner voices vs auditory hallucinationWhen I was working at a psychiatric hospital in rec therapy, as part of our orientation we had to walk around with an MP3 player and headphones playing voices. Some were friendly and flattering, and some were terrifying -encouraging self-harm and paranoia, saying that people hated you, etc. We were expected to attempt to perform certain tasks and to socialize while these voices were playing in our ears. It was a really eye-opening experience.This is exactly what I was looking for. As someone who doesn't have any type of hallucinations, it's completely impossible for me to comprehend not know something unnatural, such as the flies, isn't real. I mean before the flies starting appearing you knew nothing like that exists in reality, so what exactly happens to make you believe they are, even if you see them and feel the pain. You're aware of your condition and how it causes you to experience things that aren't real. It's just so difficult to understand, you know?

In a way, I wish I could experience it for just one moment so that I could understand. In another way, I absolutely do not want that at all. I've taken seroquel for bipolar disorder. It was years ago but I'll never touch that shit again. It turned me into a zombie - I was always sleeping, having the weirdest dreams, and it took away my ability to feel almost anything. I was numb to everyone/thing around me. It also made me suicidal, worse than I've ever been before. Once I found myself counting them every night to see if I had enough to OD on, I quit them. The week or two of withdrawals after that were even worse, a living hell. It took so long to get out of my system. Fuck that shit. 

EDIT: as u/csilvert mentioned, medication really depends on the person. This is just my own experience with it, but it can work wonders for some, just like any other medication. Your comment is almost verbatim identical to testimony given by schizophrenics during murder trials when they're asked why they're not taking medication.

You are going to hurt someone, and it really will be your fault.Buddy...

If you're experiencing hallucinations that intense, you absolutely **need** to be on medication.

It sucks, because those medicines can make you feel muted or dumbed down, but without them you're going to have an episode that could end very badly.  You could end up hurting or killing yourself or someone else.

Please, for your own sake, seek help and try additional medications.  Going untreated for what you described is absolutely not the right choice.The problem with medication used in psychiatry is that it works differently on every person, because the small differences in their disease symptomatically and their personality makes it all but impossible to figure out the best medication for them without trying it out. I understand that it feels like the doctors have no idea what they're doing when they keep giving you pills that doesn't work, but that's because they're trying the medication that works best for most people first and then working their way down the ranks until they find what's best for you. It is incredibly frustrating, but those sorts of medications exist because we know that they can help once we've figured out the right treatment. 
Certain psychiatric diseases (such as depression or manic episodes) can actually do damage to your brain if left untreated, so please speak to your doctor again regarding medication. It might feel as if you're a guinea pig, and the meds can have side effects, but it can also do wonders for you when you find the right set of pills.when was the last time you tried going to a dr ? Medications have really advanced alot recently. And it's more than likely that you need to be on medicine or else you could become a danger to yourself or others.[deleted][deleted]FYI, you can "save" comments (it's one of the options beneath a comment)Lol. If it was that easy I wouldn't have been hospitalized four or five times. It also pisses them off when I deny there existence and things degenerate.[deleted]Is it like when you're having a conversation with "someone" while half asleep, or you think you said something but you didn't? Because that always seems real but it's not.This is really interesting. I never considered hallucinations being a thing in your memories. This is really interesting! I thought something like this would be the case. It's very interesting how someone's mind can just sort of...realize it made a mistake I guess. [deleted]That sounds scary as fuck. Imagine waking up and seeing some guy at the end of your bed.Ever experiment with a smartphone to see if they show up on the camera?Oh that's interesting. I can't imagine just seeing random people popping up, that would suck!When you said hi did they just disappear how does that end?This used to happen to me! It doesn't any more, but I kind of thought it was just normal... do you know any more about this type of hallucination?So if not schizophrenia, what do you think it's caused by? We all need to give a monthly donation to charities like ‘ mind ‘ I have visual hallucinations, more like extremely vivid dreams as they happen most often under times of extreme stress or sickness and are associated with being in a half concious state such as sick with the flu or under some kind of heavy drug in the hospital. Mine are usually cats, memories, sometimes combined with fears.

My favourite was when I was in the hospital. A black cat was sitting on my chest, it had beautiful green eyes and looked so soft. I could feel it purring but eventually got too hot so shooed it off. My mom told me I was saying "go away cat, you're heavy."

My most recent was last night. I potentially have the flu and sorta hovered in a half-concious state for most of the night/early evening. I heard claws on the floor by the bathroom and I look over to see one of the cats chasing a mouse. The mouse takes off into the bedroom and jumps on my head with the cat following soon after. I could feel it moving around on my pillow and when I finally get the guts to move, I could move just didn't want to, my one cat was sleeping on me feet and the other was sleeping in the livingroom.

My fiancé's favourite is the time I yanked him off the couch. I was having a tough time with my anxiety and meds and had fallen asleep in his lap. He was playing one of those stupid ps3 wrestling games, 2K13 maybe? And I ended up dreaming I was watching a wrestling match. I woke up and stood up when all of a sudden a dude in tights jumped out at me. I woke up on the floor after having grabbed my fiancé by the neck in some sort of choke hold and rolling off the couch. That sounds like a Datura tripThat is something I do....I realized over the last few months I wake up thinking I'm talking to a person on a chair in my bedroom until I realize there's no one there. Just the empty chair.Wow. I wish I could experience it just to know what it's like. I mean all my visuals seem like I can't tell if I'm just imagining stuff. Like I saw a white guy turn black as he was walking down the street or vise versa, but I didn't see it happen, he was white, I looked down when I looked back he was black. I just can't imagine seeing like a baby elephant standing at the end of your bed and it being so real it's blocking out the tv...that's crazy! It's so interesting how each person experiences schizophrenia differently, still sucks though.Yea something about schizophrenics having shrunken brain regions, can't remember where though. Yes at times it is impossible to tell hallucination from reality, that's why you catch some schizophrenics talking to stuff that's not there, or doing like me being blacked out and literally hallucinating everything around you. Sometimes I can tell, but I think that's because I now know of my condition. I don't know however why my brain doesn't override that knowledge and continue to be fully sick as though I never knew, I don't see how knowing can effect an episode, but it seems like it does somehow.Lol, sorry that image is funny not the situation. Yea I didn't believe weed could cause hallucinations but it does, in fact as a schizophrenic I can attest that it seems to mimic a psychotic episode with the paranoia and feeling like you're connected to everything(maybe that was the actual schizophrenia), I'm surprised I liked weed considering how much I hated psychosis.I have a childhood schoolmate like that. Completely normal person growing up, when he turned 18 it was like hitting a brick wall. He now thinks he is a Shaman and is completely incoherent. He belongs in a hospital but his family wont do it after hearing all the horror stories. instead, they all take care of him and it has really effected their lives.Oh dear. I am so much grateful for my life now. Hearing these stories actually makes you feel you shouldnt be crying about little things when people have it so so much worse. I hope one day they find some magical cure for this condition. Six years in hospital is insanity in this day in age. 6 months is the longest ive seen for a SEVERE schizoaffective disorder who got much better with captain clozapine and sgt sodium valproate.This honestly makes me feel like I got off easy when comparing to my terrible OCD. Like at least I’m able to live a life more normal than that, even if I still have to put up with depression as a result of it and the terrible obsessive unpleasant thoughts and problems that make me feel like are trying to cripple me.Also have a schizoaffective friend. As a layperson I can't see the difference between her disorder and full schizophrenia, she has full auditory and visual hallucinations (like her shoes Mooing at her). It gets worse every year but at least her family is wealthy so she doesn't have to work or anything. I feel really badly for people who don't have the resources she does.My sister (now 32) was diagnosed Bipolar with schizoeffective disorder when she was 11. For the longest time it was like that: in and out of hospitals and psych wards. She once cut all her hair off with a kitchen knife because the devil told her to. Eventually she found some medication that worked for her manic depression and eventually found herself able to ignore the schizofrenia. Shes now a totally functional adult.May I ask... when you have a (can I call it a hallucination?) visual like "people who aren't there," do they look just as real and solid as actual people, or is there anything that can help you tell "that's not real"?What do you think of this culturally-affected schizophrenia research? https://news.stanford.edu/2014/07/16/voices-culture-luhrmann-071614/I have a really great ability to connect with people because I'm both highly empathetic and highly logical. I ask a lot of people about their problems and feelings and try and connect with them and help them explain something in their heads. Is there really no approach to communicating with someone long term and reaching past the hallucinations? It's stuff like this that makes me question the idea of a benevolent god.  If humans are your children, why would you leave them to suffer like this?Wow this is so sad and unfair. :( This must be such hell for her because in her reality, all that seems so REAL. It may seem amusing and intangible to an outsider, but in her perspective she’s living it like as if they were actually real no matter how much she tries to rationalise to herself that they’re not. Is this correct?this to me so much so much so much!

I thought it was maybe just because I've been a massive music fan/audiophile for decades, and am otherwise creative (I'm a writer). I can legitimately hear the separate instrumentation. I've  hummed it often to my wife and even notated it occasionally . . . The conspiracy theorist in me thinks radio waves being picked upI had a single experience lying in bed where I started hearing rock music in my head. Then it "shifted" and I could hear it for real. Faint and tinny, but right inside my ear and very real. It was a fascinating thing, but it hasn't happened since. Do they sound like they're coming from outside your head? As opposed to how something sounds when you imagine it.Songs being a stuck in your head and not ever going away can be a symptom of mild OCD. The "obsessive" bit, being that your brain doesn't ever want to let go of the song. I have it as well. I take a medication for chronic depression, and while it helps with my mood, it greatly increases the tendency for my brain to get stuck on a verse in a song or a phrase or sound. I found it annoying at first but I've just gotten used to always having a bit of noise in my head and I try to just move my brain on to a different sound rather than silence my inner noise completely. Sometimes a certain lyric will play in my head over and over again throughout the day or something like that. More of an earworm though I guessThis happens to me if I have gone a few days without adequate sleep. It's like having a song stuck in your head, but you are hearing it as if it's coming from some external music player. Sometimes it's whole songs, sometimes it's just the same refrain over and over.You should really learn an instrument and study some jazz theory. 

I have music running through my head all day. Sometimes it’s music I’ve heard before, sometimes it’s something I’m making up, and sometimes it’s a mix of two

Sometimes I️ hear full orchestrations, right now I have Pink Floyd’s - another brick in the Wall, the pulse live album version running through my head. I️ can hear the choir harmony doing the descended chordal run before the guitar comes in. 

Players usually call I️t your minds ear. It’s a good sign of strong tonal memory. I️ think it’s a gift, and learning to play an instrument will help satisfy your minds ear to actually hear those melodies. 
This exact same thing happens to me when I’m sleep  deprived.  I’m talking a good 48 hours of no sleep.  It’s exactly as you described but goes away after I’ve slept. In my experience the musical hallucinations come during a wide variety of white/background noise situations, like when I can't quite hear the department store music and then find out that there isn't any playing, or during the shower when I hear the neighbors music real loud, but they just happen to turn it off exactly when i turn off the water.  The most common is when I am driving and I reach to turn the volume up or change the song only to find that nothing has been playing.Right hereI sometimes get musical hallucinations when I've smoked a lot. It's a weird thing.As long as you know they are internal you are fine, but the frequency that you hear them is not common for a person who knows they are internal. But to be considered an auditory hallucination I believe you have to think it is coming from an external source. My uncle has paranoid schizophrenia and has been of medication most of his life. He primarily has auditory hallucinations such as radios that aren't on tell him people want to kill my mom etc. His is advanced, but short answer is yes.> Is this something that happens to anyone else?

Wait, this is something that *doesn't* happen to everybody? Essentially the only time I don't music playing in my head is when I'm really focusing on other noises in my head.Glad you commented! I was reading that last comment thinking "sometimes that happens to me" happy to hear it's not a concern after all!We have white noise machines in our and our kids’ bedrooms. I can pick out repeating patterns of sound that change if I turn my head. I’ve always wondered if it’s actually in the white noise or if I just think it’s there. White noise hallucinations are really weird. There was a fan going last night while I was falling asleep and my brain started hearing a bunch of weird noises, including something like a lawnmower starting. I can usually deal with hypnagogic hallucinations, but it was bad enough that I had to put on music just to be able to fall asleep.Happens more when I’m stoned tooIt *is* a hallucination, though?My parents have a radio in their bathroom that they often forget to turn off when they leave the house. About 30% of the time I hear it and go into their room to turn it off, it was off already.I thought I explained I am not actually. This was just a phenomenon that would occasionally bother me in the shower. Until I realized it was simply the echoes of the water making noises that my brain would try to process. Since the sounds were gibberish it would fill in the blanks with whatever it could. The same way your eyes fill in the blanks with optical illusions your ears will do the same with sounds. In my case it took the form of rock music. It's not even that weird that the comment is edited, mostly just that so few people seem to have noticed. Well thanks for shedding some light on it. Speaks to the lack of understanding we have as a whole here in the states about mental illness. I'm a full grown college educated dude and was under the impression people with schizophrenia couldn't function outside of mental hospitals.Those North American house spiders. Agh. Also fastest in the world according to Guinness book of world records. Same, music is continuously playing, as if it’s a radio station playing the same chorus of the same song for 10 hours straight (not that I’m schizophrenic)

Out of curiosity, have you ever tried meditating?What kind of music do you hear?Does the music ever cause problems when you get to sleep? The thought of never ending things like tinnitus is a real fear of mineHer acknowledging that she needed help was the largest step. The drugs are really quite good now. But it takes a village of support, and the patient has to really believe in themselvesIn addition to that I was relieved that the doggie was okay =)Only with physical access to the TV. They need physical access to do this. This also happened before this information was known to the public. I sincerely hope this sort of thing never happens to anyone else. Meds are a godsend for schizophrenia but they're no help if the people they're supposed to be helping don't take them. I'm sorry, that's got to be pretty scary.

My mom's a schizophrenic, and it started getting bad just after 9/11. The first thing I remember was riding with her in the car, we were stopped at a red light best to a middle eastern guy. There was an ambulance with it's sirens on driving down the street and she started yelling "it's him, hit him!" I was young and that terrified me. 

To make it worse, my parents never explained what was going on with her until about six years later. > She a!so doesn't believe my dad is her husband.

I had to rub my monitor to see if there was a spot lol. It's definitely there!I don't blame you for not wanting to share. I imagine it's hard on you and your family to go through this. Yeah I understand 10p% man. It must be hard to be around. It's just I don't know what it is like for people to have that kind of disorder and was only curious. 


Hope you are doing well and you both have a bright future ahead of you.I have never been so relieved to just be the first type of anxious. Reading responses like this is really making me worried, I've been suspicious before that I might have schizophrenia, and I've had drug-induced psychosis before a few times. Is there anything I should look out for at this stage?My favorite part of it was how they were going to torture me to death, castrate me, and label me a pedophile. Ooh boy 2011 was great fun.Well I definitely intermittently think people have ulterior motives and they’re all against me. Also highly anxious. Some cognitive decline and placed on ADHD meds. And my mom always tells me I’m lucky I didn’t inherit my dad’s “crazy gene.” Maybe I should see a specialist :/That sounds absolutely exhausting. I can imagine thinking like that just leaves you completely drained at the end of the day.I very actively have to think myself out of being the "center" of it.  If I can't I spiral into a Truman Show type ideology where I'm a source of entertainment for another group of people somewhere.  I know it sounds ridiculous, but I chalked it up to ancient aliens messing with my mind.  Cameras are also a constant thought.  And I can't believe shadow figures are a thing for others.  Sometimes I lunge up from sleep out of bed to try fight them.  My main question is, I'm not diagnosed as anything but does anyone feel exercise helps with any of it or am I just a hypochondriac trying to be part of something?  Sorry guys, id like to go ask for help and I wanna figure out what to ask for.  So many times I don't know how to explain myself when I go in and I just talk about being anxious or depressed.  I never talk about the bizarre stuff.  And I lie about the sex because I'm so ashamed.  Sorry again for the rambling.I did not, until this post, fully understand/empathize with schizophrenia.  So, I am a fairly anxious person and a hypochondriac.  It gets worse when I'm stressed.  I went through a particularly bad period where several times a day I compulsively thought I was bleeding to death internally. Logically, I knew it wasn't true, but that doesn't matter.  In my brain, it *felt* completely true. The way you know who your mom is or when your birthday is. Up is up, down is down, and I am bleeding to death.  

Wresting control back from that kind of surety about something totally fabricated is insanely difficult.  If schizophrenia involves feeling that sure about all your hallucinations, plus your brain generating massively more fake things for you to have to sort into true and untrue... fuck.  That sounds impossible.  I have some of these same thought patterns and it's caused me to withdraw completely from my friends. I can go weeks without leaving my house, I don't have a social circle anymore, working in an office is very difficult, etc. 

Every time I see a doc though I get put on depression and anxiety meds. How did you tell your doctor about these symptoms? I've seen several and tried to explain myself, but I don't know how to explain the crazy shit that is holding me back without grabbing their face and screaming "I HAVE SEVERE DELUSIONS SOMETIMES". Any advice?The "everyone is conspiring against me" and the constant suspicion of ulterior motives hits incredibly close to home. I'm really considering seeing someone soon. Am I the only person who pities anyone who actually knows my thoughts, as they must be bored as shit? :/ I have high anxiety.  One of the things that go through your mind during a panic attack is that you are going crazy.  Therapists and doctors will tell you this is just panic, but reading all of these posts where one of the first symptoms is high stress, it just feeds the panic, you know?Anxiety and panick attacks are sadly real close buddies. Often skipping together. Bastards.20, and in college (still am). Me too, I just believe we've grown up stressed outBeen diagnosed with ADHD, actually, and among all the various disorders that I've been diagnosed with, that one is the most distinct. Were there any symptoms when you were a child?Hey summer of 2016 for me as well. Turned 20 and the voices I'd been hearing for a while turned nasty. Telling me to hurt my family and  particularly our pets. Then my parents went on vacation and I didn't talk to anyone for 3 weeks, stayed shut in the house for the entire time. I was convinced my neighbors were watching me and sabotaging my car. Spent my entire time on the computer with headphones on trying to drown out the voices. Was afraid to go to sleep at night because I had nothing to drown them out with and that was always the worst time for me so I stopped sleeping. I stayed up for 60 hours, slept for 6 then stayed up for 55 hour. Did that for a week and a half till my parents got home and saw the state of me and the house and dragged me to a doctor. Sure glad they did.What anti psychotic do you use currently out of curiosity? Here's hoping it was only drywall and not brick.You really don’t want to give SSRIs to bipolar people.Oh, man. That sounds terrifying.Thank you for taking care of yourself.  You have no idea how much it means to the people around you.  Please know that.Thanks for the kind words, I very much appreciate it. (I'm not much of a music listener. I sometimes find it over stimulating but I will definitely check it out shortly.) Take care. Well im on auto pilot a lot of times. Paying hardly any attention to anything and my situational awareness is in the toilet. Now stack that on top of memory loss. 

Example being I will say something and when someone says I said it a second ago, I will argue saying that I didn't. Which in turn wakes up my imagination that everyone is against me and wants to harm me in some way.Yes, I was put on Klonopin (Clonazepam) after my mother passed. I was on it for 7 years. I went off of it a couple of times during those 7 years, and every time. Psychosis. That’s why I would always get back on it.

Benzodiazepines are terrible drugs.[deleted]I also sometimes have (and had often as a kid) these outsize tongue\body feelings op described, mostly during fights (high stress\anxiety) and some of the social aspects are too familiar... Reading about schizotypal disorder it's pretty unlikely I have this, but still kinda freaked out now...I fear this is getting dangerously close to revealing personal enough information that my account risks being identified by people who know me. But the name is 'Sol'. Or 'Saul'. [removed][removed][removed]https://www.ted.com/talks/elyn_saks_seeing_mental_illnessYes I've read that one too! It's very good!No, it's not like that at all. It's mostly about how she struggles with psychosis while trying to lead a normal life. I have chronic depression too and I still related to it quite a bit.[removed]Hey this is really good! I normally skip around songs to see if I like them the first time but I just listened to that the whole way through, it’s great.Lol that changes a lot thpught it was a term for what you call your hallucinations.I was thinking more specifically about the schizoid part, since, as far as I am aware, SPD does not develop into anything, but it *is* more prevalent in people who has family members with schizophrenia (which would make one more likely to get/have schizophrenia).

Perhaps the initial diagnosis of SPD was a misdiagnosis, because schizophrenia had not fully manifested(?) yet, and you only had negative symptoms at the time.

But I'm just kinda thinking out loud, you know.[deleted]Say the girl is named Sally Smith. A court won't issue a restraining order telling you to keep away from Sally Smith if she's not real. If she's not real, but she's the imaginary child of someone, the order could exist but would name the parents.

Courts aren't going to entertain someone's schizophrenic delusions as if imaginary people are real.[deleted]jesus that's really sad. I mean, do you tell them "I'm not saying I saw her, guys, I'm talking about my past with her"? how do they respond to this, if so??Well either she could, or I was being ripped off bigly.

Just kidding. She could speak Russian, and had even spent some time in Russia, which was very rare for South Africans at the time.How long is "too long" for staring into the void?  I occasionally snap out of that, not quite sure how long it lasted but probably brief. Catatonia is the exact thing you're describing. Aaaaaand I can't sleep anymore.I hope you’re getting help to deal with the suicidal thoughts, that’s something I don’t suffer from now thankfully. 
You need coping strategies, if you’ve heard of CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) I would highly recommend it. I’ve heard good things from service users themselves. Instead of going over and over the problems you’re experiencing, you’re given coping mechanisms to try and prevent the behaviour (ie; cutting)   
I’m no expert by the way, I’ve worked in the field for a good few years however. 
Hope you find the help and support you need. As a dude who really just needs to go to sleep, I agree wholeheartedly.Haha, glad to help!Thanks so much for the reply. I know that most of the meds out there have some pretty significant side effects and where I'm completing my practicum, the doctors don't seem as sympathetic to that fact. And that has to be difficult as a patient. I take meds for my RA and the side effects suck for that, but in a totally different way (I'm not equating them, just relating to the existence the way that I can) and I know people don't understand why I *wouldn't*want to take them.  

I really appreciate your suggestion for how to respond when someone experiences a reality different from mine and I will be incorporating that one. ;) I would never tell them it isn't real because I know it is for them, but knowing what to say in general is helpful. 

Thank you again. > Exploding head syndrome.

I did not know this was a thing. I read it and have always had those issues. Thank you!Speaking of exploding heads and paranoia, one time when I was like 5 I had a dream where there was a boy who thought too hard and his head literally exploded, and for months afterwards I was paranoid that it'd happen to me lolPut myself on crutches once doing the sleep spider dance - stay safe at night, friend.When I was a kid I had fun ones.. like watching a tv that wasnt there or seeing a plate of cookies beside me.

Now it's all screaming, shadow people and heavy breathing. I just don't open my eyes until I can move anymore. Goddamn fucking hypnagogic spiders. I’m really afraid of spiders in general so whenever I get this I jolt up or even scream, scares the hell out of my poor boyfriend The same woman's voice I don't recognize that says things like "you're stupid" when I'm working on something that requires concentration. It's very faint though, so I don't know if me mind is playing tricks on me. I'm 19 currently used to wake up as a kid hearing a scream, on occasion as a teenager doors slamming. was working away once heard loud banging, got up checked the apartment, next morning police were down stairs investigating an armed robbery lolAh, just your standard, run-of-the-mill telekinetic episode. No biggie.As someone who gets frequent sleep paralysis, this is in a sense one of my greatest fears - that something legitimately threatening will actually be happening and I'll just assume it's more sleep paralysis and not respond. I have hypnogagic/hypnopompic hallucinations, auditory ones, and one night as I was falling asleep I woke up to a tremendously loud bang. My dog, who was sleeping next to my feet at the bottom of my bed, didn't react and no one else in the house seemed to've woken up to investigate, so I chalked it up to the hallucinations and went back to sleep.

Turns out our kitchen light cover had fallen off and shattered all over the floor.I've had a spider in my ear recently, it didn't make any noise but my ear was hurting so bad that it felt like it was trying to tear my ear apart.

It was really scary since I'm scared of those little shits, just the thought of it makes me shiver.Yeah I was straight up panicking about these until I found this!!Right? When I tried to see if my parents had it too they didn’t believe it was real based on that nameI've found in more often a man than a woman in my dreams. Which is odd, because I'm a cis-gendered woman. Brains are just weird.I've found someone else! I try to explain this other people. But, when I dream I'm not aware of my actual life or existence. I AM that other person now. With all their thoughts and feelings and memories. 

I do dream of being myself sometimes, but it's usually mundane things. I don't think this is that weird, I am often not 'myself' in dreams either and sometimes I am just an observer.The parts about the laughing gas, the female voice, the warping, the spiders, and moving acne is all while I'm fully awake.

They are what I'm really worried about.Yea, its almost like my half awake thoughts are counter measures agains waking up. Super unhelpful when i try to explain that i am late because my dreams told me I didn't need to get up.Totally agree weed etc can make it million times worse like weed induced psychosis That's why I said it's not good for people who might have it. I understand the risks. I specifically said if he is past the age where it most commonly presents itself. From my DSM5: "the peak age for the first psychotic episode is in the early to mid 20s for males and late 20s for females".Once you hit 30 it's extremely unlikely that you'll develop symptomsMost schizophrenia cases show around 18-22, so don't take medical advice from me but I would say 24-25+What was your irrational logic? Just curious.Married, house owner *and* murder-free? Wow. Even without schizophrenia, it is incredibly hard to do all three of those things at once. Good on ya![deleted]well its nice that he stayed with you through it[removed][removed][removed][removed][removed]Thank you for sharing! I know how therapeutic it can be to just tell your story. I must say you seem like an incredibly strong and resilient person, and the fact that you’re doing so well now gives me hope. You seem to be in a supportive environment, that’s awesome. I don’t have schizophrenia, but I have been through a period of intense paranoid psychosis brought on by drug addiction, and causing me to drop out of the university I worked so hard to be at. I’ve had depression and anxiety since I was young. I was formally diagnosed with a dissociative disorder (among many other things) in rehab. I’ve taken the past couple years off to work on my health (I have chronic Lyme disease as well, and one of the symptoms has been hallucinations for most of my life) and I’m finally about to go back to school and I’m apprehensive. Anyway, thank you. I guess what I’m trying to say is our struggles may have been different, but I feel you man. 

Edit: Also I can totally identify with the anxiety spike around the election. I think that day was horrific for a lot of us. Fingers still crossed he gets taken down before we lose our much-needed healthcare.That's so sadThat's definitely possible.  I don't think I've heard that as a theoretical explanation before, but I'm also not super familiar with the literature.  Whether or not it's been put forward as an explanation before, I think it's really interesting and plausible.Sounds familiar as in something you've experienced? He's not really a bad psychiatrist. He's helped me a lot but does chalk a lot of things up to stress. But I mean, of course I'm stressed. I'm a complete wreck. perhaps I haven't been serious enough, or holding back when describing my symptoms. But regardless, I can get a referral to have a full blown evaluation done. The thing that pissed me off is I just had a full test done and when it came time she, "couldn't diagnose me" but said something was really off and she's "never seen anything like it". Can you please share more about the 2014 year?Holy shit that just basically explained everything that I couldn't put into words. Gonna get myself checked out because that's almost identical to my life experience.[removed]aww! I'm so happy it helped, good luck out there> That's a rather nice way to look at it. I don't know if I'd want to even try to unify the "Devil" and "God" in my mind from before. It sounds like it would end up either very good or very, very bad, and a 50/50 chance for each.

Yea I think in *general* humans are uneasy with dealing with how they can be evil. I think it's hard to really grasp the idea that it's not hard to be evil and as an individual one always has the capacity to be powerful and destructive and amoral and all these things. But for whatever reason we tend to choose not to.

Bill Burr has this routine where he talks about how when you're driving, all it takes is to rotate your hand by 2 degrees and you can end a couple lives. That is the line between order and disorder, sanity and insanity, 2 measly degrees. I think on average as humans we have a difficult time coming to terms with this notion and are terrified by the idea that our ordered and 'sane' world is really a massive house of cards that's held together almost miraculously. 

So I can imagine why trying to unify the 'Devil' and 'God' seems terrifying and dangerous. Who knows which way you'll end up leaning...2 degrees left or 2 degrees right? Odds seem 50/50, as you say.

I was also curious about the 'homicidal episodes'. What does it feel like? Did you rationalize it to yourself? Was it something you could only rationally approach after the fact? Was there a sense of pleasure associated with the acts or was it more of a sense that "I could do this right now if I wanted to"? I'm trying to imagine the mindset/path down this road.

edit:

> I've actually gotten into the habit of talking to myself (it's probably a bit too extreme; I do it regardless of where I am, who's around, etc., and sometimes talk about... stuff I probably shouldn't talk about in public. And I randomly just find myself saying "fuck" or "dammit" over and over again under my breath. I guess I've really integrated those voices into myself, even if they aren't "here" anymore).

Hmm this is interesting. I sort of do this too. Sometimes if I'm trying to figure something out and I'm in public I realize how weird it is that I'm sort of discussing out loud. Perhaps this is the natural response to internal conflict, and the distinct voices are what you hear when the internal conflict is fractured/unintegrated for whatever reason. Maybe we *all* have these voices, but for most it's integrated. Maybe your hearing of the voices truly is a testament to the inner workings of the mind which are usually shrouded in the subconscious. Thanks for sharing your story. I'm currently trying to write my thesis on the topic of consciousness and I'm trying to understand the story of your experience in the context of my research. So very fascinating, so very ominous. 
It may be connected in some way, but there's no way to know, and you certainly couldn't have known beforehand anyway. Stress can be a factor in triggering these problems, but they're always a long time coming based on brain abnormalities that have developed. It's more physical than psychological re: cause and effect. I bet you just mean you have an abstract feeling more than you truly blame yourself, but I just wanna underline that, in general, when a mental episode occurs, no one is to blame. Haha xD how exciting. It reminds me of music I've heard on dreams.


how do they phrase the things they say? I’m so sorry. That actually makes me wonder if some people who wrote the Bible had a similar condition with those visions.  Just tried the thinking of a kitten and my mind has slowed down immensely.[removed]Join a gym and do a bit of exercise or some hobby and try and eat well I found found seafood to be great. 
When you go to the doctors don't just take some anti depressants or whatever they decide to give you ask for a blood test first there's a few things that can cause depression e.g. Thyroids or vitamin deficiency. 
If you do end up on medication like anti depressants just know it will take around 6 to 8 weeks to start working and they may even not it's all rng if that's what you wanna call it. 
Hope that helps you're welcome. i also get it more when i'm very tired. i also find that i don't get it when i have something on in the background too. 

that can backfire on me once in a while though. if i binge on a show too much the voices become the voices of the characters in the show!It was at the 36-hour point that I started seeing shadows and such. Isn't really vivid though, more like they're there in my peripheral vision, but if I turn around it's not there. Don't think I've ever hit 48 hours tho (or maybe I did, but definitely never have done more than that).Thank you for this. Both my parents are vets and we were stationed out there for years. My father still lives there and I wonder if the state of the VA and it's services (which I remember visiting in my childhood) affected his mental health status.Yeah, I can’t have it either anymore, I get way to anxious. I’ve had some in Portland Oregon, where it’s recreationally legal, so I got some with CBD and THC in it in a 1:1 ratio (normal stuff you get has 10-20% THC but only 0.001% CBD) and the CBD helped me and my then GF not have a panic/anxiety attack, so I enjoyed it. But if I have even a mild drag off something that doesn’t have an appreciable amount of CBD then my heart races and I feel like I’m having a heart attack, so I just don’t have it anymore. POC = person of color?

Who cares what your mom thinks. She isn't you. Are you over 18?

whats more important to you? A few ignorant people in your community looking at you funny because you see a therapist? Or not having a crippling disability.Well, I didn't mean to come on strong... It's not scary for everyone else. I just meant it is something that I would find very out of the ordinary, if I were you. Believe me, working in an ER, I see lots of people who come in for a one-hour headache, and wonder why they came. However, I see some people get into real bad shape because they wait too long to seek help. Either way, I get paid by the hour. Doctors make bank off insurance. Don't be afraid to get a professional opinion. You're not bothering someone who's whole job in life is to take care of other humans. Outside of the occasional "why is that person doing this job", most people are perfectly content to help you out. You're no bother! Good to hear that you're well. 

You know, you often hear about how people suffering from mental illnesses "complain" (sorry, for my lack of appropriate phrasing) that their meds make them feel "like a zombie" or "off". Do your meds affect you like that? And do you prefer feeling off to suffering from the symptoms of your illness?I agree. Pharmaceuticals may be the easiest way to restore a baseline so you can get back to being a productive car-driving job-working capitalist, but people forget that the way we live today is total insanity compared to the environment in which we evolved. Drugs might help you bludgeon your neurology into something more compatible with the prevailing Western lifestyle, but faith and spirituality are more likely to give you the perspective you need to step back and re-assess your environment. I guess we just prefer to believe that people are broken, rather than admit that there might be things beyond our control or understanding.I stand corrected then.THE MOMENT: was getting passport photo for the JET application across the street from the office. Heard a familiar voice talking into a cell while I waited. (I’ve run Every scenario backward and forward and Everything goes back Here) said yeah, here. Yeah Real skinny (I was 135# at 5’9” and didn’t consider myself “skinny” maybe thin (and well above required for anorexia diagnosis) My brain would Not have manifested that. Then said, yeah hot red car. Why?- I honestly After 12-13 years believe this part happened. I felt “weird” and began panic attack (which I’ve been Separately prone to since early college) got my photos and left in a hurry. HERE’S the difference: they followed me. Taking the Same turns. I ran into my acupuncturist’s office and asked to stay for half an hour. They were still outside waiting on me. None of THAT “really” occurred. From that One point on (after leaving the store) everything I’ve “heard” and “seen” Are consistent in some manner of another with my own personal self hatred, loathing, and fear. I am in Computer Science, not neuroscience. I'd call this a 'bug'.Same. I went up to 40 for a while, but it made the side effects unbearableOops I'm sorry! I guess I forgot to mention the point of my long story, it's that paranoia doesn't necessarily mean she has schizophrenia. It could be from loneliness(in which case, taking her out for spa day or something nice like that can make a world of difference and when we don't get out much, our mind can get the better of us and imagination will go wild), bad medication mix or she's not properly taking them, or some weird side effect from meds. Other diseases also have schizophrenic symptoms so ultimately try and find a way for her to get fully checked out because it might be something that a doctor can actually treat and she doesn't have to suffer from those thoughts anymore. Yeah, these auditory/visual hallucinations are produced by the brain and are interpreted as real by the brain. There doesn’t need to be external input to trigger a response in the brain. When schizophrenic people say they hear voices, they actually hear them. Oh, I see. Misread the situation. Good luck, though. Well, if youre really feeling that concerned Go Talk to your doctor and He will probably point you in the right direction to go next. Good luck. :)no no. I wasn't suggesting that it is...

sorry!I wasn't trying to suggest that I had schizophrenia; i was attempting to point out that the person I was responding to may not have what they think they do. perhaps I dropped the ball quite impressively. sorry. What are they usually like?Weird since a lot of these posts probably fall under that heading then... Anyways, thanks!I mean the people (you referencedd in your last sentence) probably weren't ever even diagnosed to begin with.I don't have any hallucinations except at night as well. And especially after a scary dream. It sucks. I can't imagine going through it in the daylight like some of the people on this thread.Fun fact: it's where the bloody Mary story came from. Spinning + low flickering candlelight = hallucinating a murder ghost.Oh yeah. I was referring to mood symptoms, the hallucinations and delusions became constant until I got medicated. Contrary to what the drug commercials on TV tell you, you shouldn't actually go to the doctor and say "hey doc, I need X".

A doctor is going to prescribe things until they find what works for you.Exactly. And because I have a heavy tendency to isolate myself, I never talked to anyone to disprove my theory of what normality really was. I think it's probably the same way for a lot of folks. Wait why is this word ???? It does to me too!!What do you mean it makes you nauseous? Can you explain that more?I haven't but now I may watch it. Hmm. I'll get back to you on it. I had to find the right meds. Which meant trialing, a lot. It sucked. But no, I don't feel like a shell of myself but that's maybe a biased opinion. I didn't really feel human at all before i got help. The only thing is that I don't feel as creative and my moods aren't as extreme. Like I can't get 'jump up and down screaming' excited anymore. It's hard to explain but I wouldn't go off my medications for any reason. Not worth it. There was one experience that truly scared the shit out of me though. There wasnt any noise when it dragged its nails so i think thats why it didnt bother me. A couple weeks ago i pulled up next to mt fiances car in the dark and i looked over at her drivers seat. In the seat was an old decrepid and fat looking goblin of a woman whos head was long and gelatinous draped over the head rest and scary with long straw like hair. She turned her face towards me and had dark sunken death like eyes and her mouth fell open. Thats when i noped the fuck out and decided im in no way parking next to her van.I can't imagine experiencing something like that. Like literally cannot imagine what it must be like. Everything my brain comes up with is always something reminiscent to CGI graphics or augmented reality. why is it that schizophrenia always seems to result in seeing fucked up terrifying shit? It never seems like I hear cases of people seeing cuddly kittens frolicking around or something. ...Holy fucking shit. Also thanks for answering. I was afraid my question would come across as insensitive.It makes it better to a point. I know it's not real but it's real to ME, if that makes sense. It's like knowing you're having a nightmare, but the nightmare is still scary because you're in the middle of it. Does that make sense? It just had gotten to the point where I couldn't deal anymore. I couldn't. I was so tired of living in constant fear, that I ended up abusing prescription medications in order to make myself sleep. Which was incredibly dangerous.

Also, several times voices would say "just end it, no one fucking cares about you, you worthless piece of shit, no wonder everyone leaves you, you're such an ugly cunt, disgusting bitch" and on and on and on and on, until finally I was willing to do anything to make it stop. My mom saved my life both times. She's a literal goddamn angel.

Idk. I think the best thing I ever did was get myself medicated, and later on, into rehab. Clean and sober and happy-ish now. Like in response to stressors? No. 

I do get nervous before exams, job interviews, medical emergencies on clinical placement etc, but they're not the same stressors as per my upbringing. It was a very high risk environment and I was in and out of foster care. My mother had a similar upbringing in Singapore, with her six siblings in state care. I think many mental illnesses rely on a gene-environment interaction, which is why improving the socioeconomical circumstances of mentally unwell patients is so important. im calling bullshit on this one.Yes, I had that discussion with our academic advisor and he recommended that I do not report it. My graduating year is 2019, so I have a little while to decide. 

I was cognitively impaired in high school (poor attention, memory, other), but the early onset and visual hallucinations are atypical. My diagnosis is definitive and has been agreed upon by the different psychiatry registrars, consultants, and allied health I've rotated through. 

However, my current doctor raised an interesting point about autoimmune encephalitis. Autoimmune encephalitis (which you probably know!) is more likely to present in females, with visual hallucinations, and on a background of autoimmune disorders. I'm female and have an autoimmune condition (Sjogren's). I have a strong family history of schizophrenia and autoimmune disorders, but they're all in females on my maternal side; mother, two aunts, and grandmother. 

I asked a neurologist on my ward, and he said that autoimmune encephalitis is more likely to present acutely, with seizures and deranged vitals. But then I asked a psychiatrist! And he remarked that neurologists often encounter the acute cases, while psychiatrists are more likely to encounter the chronic cases that can masquerade as schizophrenia. 

It's an interesting iceberg to think about. To be honest, do not report to the AHPRA.  It would open up a can of worms that could take a long time to resolve and if you and your peers trust that you can manage, then you can manage.  Good luck with med school.im calling bullshit on the original commentThat is very good advice and consistent with what I've heard in the past. Thank you, I appreciate it! There are a few different ones; I think this was the one I had in mind. http://bioinformatics.charite.de/supercyp/A researcher or clinician could answer this better than I, but it's a case-by-case scenario.

There's a sentiment in the literature that since many different genes are implicated in schizophrenia, schizophrenia may actually be a number of different disorders which all present in a similar way. A person's outcome without treatment is multifactorial.

I was poring over some interesting brain MRIs with a friend recently. The study followed up people with schizophrenia to see how their brain changed over time. There was gradual atrophy, disorganization, and loss of brain volume. I was keen to actually blame antipsychotics, as they can affect the brain in adverse ways. But the study controlled for that variable. Interestingly, these were all patients who were pharmaceutically managed (they recruited from a hospital ward). It's certainly not the whole story; something as seemingly insignificant as what you ate on the day can change how you respond to a drug. But it's an important piece of the puzzle. In practice today we can do it for antidepressants - CYP2D6 for fluoxetine (Prozac) and velafaxine (Effexor), CYP2C19 for escitalopram (Lexapro). But it's more commonly done for drugs that are dangerous in very slow or very fast metabolizers. 

It's a multifactorial problem which requires a multifactorial solution. Yikes, that sounds awful! Good to meet someone who's also had tardive dyskinesia and akathisia. Severe akathisia is hard to explain in words, and it feels as though words don't do it justice. Good to hear from someone who understands. I understand your concern. My visual hallucinations have involved people who weren't there, and I've wondered before how I'd be able to tell the difference between a burglar and a hallucination if I found someone in my bedroom. And how I would react. 

I've never made an error from the condition in my part-time job as a disability support worker, or as a student on placement. Or any of my previous part-time jobs as a childcare worker, tutor, baker, etc. It's comparable to a physical condition. I know doctors with narcolepsy who have never fallen asleep on the job, surgeons with diabetes who carefully manage their levels so that they can stand without eating or drinking through long operations. I think it's about recognizing the room for error so that you can correct it before it occurs. 

I suppose that's why I've been compatible with medicine; I'm a cautious and detail-oriented person. I haven't seen her in nine years but last I heard, she's living in a shelter. My father was extradited to Germany on criminal charges, I believe he's still in jail. Yep, I've taken to medicine like a duck to water. It's like any other disadvantage or condition. All healthcare professionals have it in one way or another, it's how you approach and manage the situation. Thank you for providing all that information and sharing, very helpful! Cheers. Excellent to hear that you're in a better place now. It may not affect your application to Medical School, but it will certainly affect your application to AHPRA once you graduate and want to start working as a doctor. I have friends and classmates who have had terrible experiences with them, in one case their registration being withheld for a whole year until he could 'prove' that he was okay to practice. 
The Australian medical system is also very difficult to navigate while maintaining good mental health. I have a few friends from Australia and it seems like a wonderful place to live! I did premed at a top tier school. The amount of backstabbing and sabotage sucked. We need more doctors. Our most rural hospitals are run almost completely by locums (medical temps). Our population is ageing and we need doctors across the many special needs of the elderly. As an aside I would seriously consider whether you are in a good place if you're in a position to attend medical school. 30% of medical students become depressed, with 1 in 10 having suicidal thoughts. It's an incredible stressor to the system to work so hard for so long, and there is effectively no benefit if you end up conking out 5 years into the process (and 300,000 in debt).

I say this not to discourage you, only to encourage you to evaluate whether you're in a good place where such stressors wouldn't exacerbate an underlying predisposition to medical illness.That sounds like a really awful and terrible experience, I'm really sorry you went through that. Thank you for taking the time to write it out. 

It's very admirable that you put so much time and effort into your goals. I'd say it sounds like you have enormous potential, but that wouldn't be doing justice to all the things you've already achieved. Sending good thoughts your way. I'd also say look into nursing/PA as alternate options. While I'm glad to be on the MD side of things the PA side of things is pretty darn great too, and if I had to do it over again I might honestly opt for it as the path is so much shorter.Do you hqve a name for that pre med podcast? I drive a lot.Never too old, had a family member in WA recently go back to med school for more training in her 50s (she was a nurse earlier in life, but quite a lot had changed) and start a new job as a nurse.Paging Dr is a good internet forum that can help you with all application enquiries! Check out the old premeds community online. Also check out the premed hq podcast, it has been my best and main source of med school advising. Believe it or not, 50 and 60 year olds have matriculated into med school. It's not too late for you. 

Now that I think about it, I just listened to an episode during which the host was interviewing a 39 year old medical school matriculant. It's episode number 77 of the med school hq premed podcast. There are many, many other episodes out there for the non trad applicant as well, so I highly suggest it. I'm really sorry to hear about that. It was a great talk! The entire conference was awesome. Right back at you. Hope we run into each other. xoHe writes some blogs and articles across the internet. http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-12-07/dr-dov-degan,-a-young-doctor-with-bipolar-disorder/8100954Kind of. Stereotypy is more like, gesturing to things that aren't there (dodging invisible things, having an emphatic conversation with their own thoughts with gestures) where as OCD rituals are to comfort an anxious preoccupation; finger on mouth 10 times will magically prevent a horrible thing from happening in the future.Huh.  My BF's 20 y/o son lives with us and he's on the spectrum.  I have noticed that he walks on his toes when barefoot.  Interesting. I noticed I walk not on my tippy toes, but the front "palm" of my foot a lot, which explains why my shoes always wear out at the front, instead of the back like most people.

Also explains why I roll my ankle so damn much.I haven’t seen any research on autism and toewalking (but it could be out there) nor is it used officially as a diagnostic criteria. But in my experience, it’s one of several behaviours/ characteristics that might make me think a person has autism. Yeah, It does seem to be an autistic thing. My leather-y shoes are so worn out in the front, it's not even funny...Ditto, autistic and toe walk only when barefoot. Do I walk normally when shod by nature or by training? I don't remember. It's possible I learned to heel-toe by practicing, like the person upthread, out of desire to fit in as a youth. Or because a podiatrist, physiotherapist, or shoe salesman told me I walked "wrong" and I wanted to do everything "right".   
I had a coworker I am pretty sure was autistic too, he toe walked all the time. Oh wait a second one comes to mind from a different job! Yeah I definitely think it's common in us.Did you ever get dinosaur arms? 

I was in a questionable rehab and I think they would over prescribe some sort of outdated antipsychotic to meth addicts. They would shuffle around and always had their arms bent like dinosaurs. My friend said that he would sit down and then he immediately needed to get up, like just constantly uncomfortable. Also a lot of drooling...

It was like night and day when they would get off the meds. One guy seemed so dull and just not there, then when he got off the meds he had the quickest wit and was pretty hilarious. Sorta dude for the last year or so I've been having bad mental issues I'm calm right now so I feel like I can talk about it but yea I feel like the world is out to get me everybody even my family is in on something plotting against me...I do alot of weird shit like walking wierd too like walking a certain path or placing things in safe locations...wierd stuff dude what about you?We should make a club.This is the same with me. We had a priest come in during elementary school (I went to a Catholic school) and teach us about exorcisms and tell stories of people being possessed. For years afterwards I was terrified of being possessed and thought that the devil may be trying to speak to me. I’ve grown out of that now but I still think what the school did was very harmful to my mental health as a child.This is apparently more common than I thought. Someone should do a survey or something. Or start one of the world's least pleasant clubs.Not sure that’s the only explanation; I had more or less the same issue and my whole family, including me, have always been atheist.Agreed. OCD runs in my family. My sister has it bad - and she has Harm OCD - and often struggled/struggles with thoughts about harming others (she would never do it), and also that the devil is going to take her soul. She's been in therapy for a long time and it's helped her immensely. It depends. OCD usually stems from anxiety. The repeated actions/hoarding/etc is usually a way to alleviate the anxiety. For me, mine reduced because I got my anxiety under control on my own. I have some tendencies left but nothing that interferes too much with my life. Some people never learn coping skills and it worsens. I'm a female, 22 years old.
I only recently mentioned the visual hallucinations to my doctor but he was'nt really alarmed and told me to reduce my medication when this goes on. The strange thing is I've been taking these for half a year now and the hallucinations only started about two months back, so I actually doubt it's the medication.

Anyways, I got blood drawn for a checkup today, so maybe I'll soon know if there's something wrong with it. ^^You get him medical attention for this, right? Because what you’re saying he does is terrifying. Medication could maybe prevent him from being too damaged to recover later on. It could be intrusive thoughts similar to OCD, if there's no other such symptoms?
Eta: just noticed that you said you get it a lot of the time, it's worth looking into with a specialist just to be sureIs there a school counselor you could talk to? I know it's awkward talking about these issues, but it can be the first step to getting help.The literature around command hallucinations is pretty broad, due to its association with risk. The patients I've met have had a variety of hallucinatory experiences - heard indistinguishable whispering, saw flashing colourful lights, heard a baby crying and church bells ringing, etc. But a lot of focus is on command hallucinations ("You should hurt her" "You should burn that") and how to best treat them, due to wanting to minimize risk and harm to others.

What feels odd in regards to our knowledge of schizophrenia is that there's a large gap when it comes to categorizing types of hallucinations. There is coverage for command hallucinations, but little else. Psychiatry categorizes everything - subtyping schizophrenia, subtyping bipolar disorder, placing personality disorders into three neat brackets. But there's no formal organization of the different hallucinations people can experience. We don't have any evidence of a gene that make first order versus second order more likely, or predictive values for benign versus malevolent. 

And we don't know much about plotting the brain to find the origins of a hallucination. We do in epilepsy. We do in Charles Bonnett Syndrome, where vision loss or blindness causes the brain to 'fill in' gaps with visual hallucinations. Researchers have plotted where along the visual cortical pathway this process extends, because the visual pathway in your brain becomes more complex as it passes through more cortical areas. Someone who sees pink squares is having a hallucination from early in the pathway, someone who sees complex figures and entire people is later in the pathway. Met a poor teenager who had a developmental disability and Charles Bonnett Syndrome, who saw vampires coming for his brother.

But for whatever reason, the aetiology of hallucinations in schizophrenia remains mysterious. More literature is churning out now that neuropsychiatry as a field is gaining speed, and neuroimaging improves. It's an exciting time. Hearing voices in white noise is totally normal and isn't related to mental illness. It's more like the brain trying to make sense out of nothing and accidentally recognizing patterns that aren't there.Just throwing my absolutely uninformed assumption there that maybe they were referring to some sort of placebo effect?It's actually a pretty interesting question. I think it depends on how the brain is "simulating" the experience and what are its "goals", per se.

It seems like a lot of these experiences have an inherent frightening/threatening quality to them, while keeping a level of realism, so I'd imagine that noise cancelling headphones would indeed work, but then you'd probably have that "thing" scratching your headphones or touching your body. Total speculation on my part though.I wonder if deaf schizos would hear something And that's just for "typical/ normal" people. Now imagine what it must be like for atypical experiences, it's immense. Pranksters is totally right. I choose to believe that sleep paralysis is an accidental out of body experience.> I tend to think that the bible was more of an attempt to explain things that science now does.

Not really.

Science answers the "What?"
The focus of the bible is to answer the "Why?" although it also *sometimes* answers the "What?"

Science can never answer the "Why?" without there being a god deciding something, because otherwise there is no "Why" only a "What?" as there is no reasoning.[removed][removed][removed]Anything involving brains scare the shit out of me, specially brain damage from a stroke/alzheimer. That’s why a lot of mental patients attempt suicide. Luckily, my experience wasn’t a successful one, and I finally got the treatment I needed - I’m a much happier, productive person now. But if anyone reading this feels like they’re in “a hell they can’t escape,” you can. It might seem impossible now, but trust me, all you need to do is [ask someone for help.](https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org)Having them or other people around you having them? This may horrify you, but if you work outside of your house an office or multiple customer service job ( not private one on one ) , you are dealing with a lot of people with mental disorders. Heck, even walking down the street in the city! Hello, I'm a high-functioning schizophrenic. I have my struggles, but I also have the world's sweetest dog, a stable living situation, circles of friends both online and offline, rewarding volunteer work (largely dealing with mental illness), a talent for fiber arts, perfect skin, and more Steam games than I really need.

My life isn't a hell and you're kind of an asshole for assuming that you know the first thing about me or schizophrenia.Exactly. I heard, that the worst thing with schizophrenia is that it corrupts the contact with reality. I like the contact with the reality, please, don't take that away from me!Have you seen The Babadook? I actually thought I was going to die two days ago. I even thought my mom was gonna die. I kept watching her because she didn't look like she was breathing. She dozes off because she's 89 and that's just what happens but I've walked in on her before and I just stand there like a ghost staring at her until I could tell she's breathing or not. I think my signing my divorce papers today really added to my stress and mania. 
Hi I've been diagnosed with Schizophrenia and experience auditory visual and olfactory hallucinations. That's my diagnosis and what I live with, it's not me. I'm not offended or any of that nonsense but just wanted to say that, if you ever do have the misfortune of becoming mentally ill, it doesn't mean the end of anything, just that the way you were changes. Recovery is a long ass road, we hit bumps blow tyres and our radiators overheat while we travel it but I smile and laugh more than I cry and scream these days, so I know it's gotten better :) I will hopefully find love one day and have a family, but until then I will love life, if for no other reason but to say fuck you to the voices :))Unlike real hell, which I've escaped from more times than I care to count.Help me :cRemember when the movie Alice in wonderland land came out? Where it starts in a mental hospital? I always used to think about that. The things she experienced, what if she had hallucinated it all and was just running around her world doing things with "the mad hater." The doctors are trying to help her. But in her mind, she KNOWS everything is real and that the doctors are trying to hurt her. Makes you think, really.I feel you on that. My husband used to work 8pm until 7 or 8 in the morning and I would get creeper out more easily than usual. I was at home with two babies and my imagination would be in overdrive

Didn't help that we were living I  New Orleans during the peak of the post-Katrina crime spree. Being surrounded by abandoned and badly damaged homes was so eerie. We lived in Lakeview where the 17th Canal broke and turned it into a fetid bowl of soup with matchsticks and a few dead bodies to add flavor.

Living under the presence of armed National Guard troops with armored personnel carriers and military Humvees was also surreal. The mental health services were terribly affected a well which meant a whole lot of mentally ill people who had just experienced a hugely traumatic event were untreated and on the streets. It was nearly impossible for me to find a psychiatrist accepting patients because of the exodus of so many folks. I had great insurance and just needed a doc to write my maintenance scripts for antidepressants and it took ages to find anyone. My breakdown?  It wasn't scary when I was in it.  My state of mind was one where I would go into a neighboring canyon by my house at around 3am and talked to trees and watch the stars.  I actually would have gladly stayed in that reverie, in my own world for a long time if I didn't see that I was really worrying my family, and mostly my mom who would take care of me.  

Once I snapped out of it, I realized how dangerous my situation was.  Not in a physical sense, I never felt I was in any danger, (although now I don't want to go down the canyon anymore), but my mental health.  When at first it was a nice, everything is okay, everyone should feel this way sometime.  It turned into Fuck you, you worthless piece of skin, in what way are you contributing?  You aren't helping anyone.  Noone likes you.

At the very end is when I felt I needed to get help.  But it starts all of sudden and can happen with any big change in your life.  Mine was losing my job, and questioning my sexuality, as well as coming to terms with my father's death and religion.  Sorry, didnt mean to be mean. Just thought your response was funny and tried to join in. I hope you do sleep well, and the little one also. 

Cheers.Maybe it has something to do with an individual's sense of authority being placed with the family unit versus the state.

Like, maybe the person views the authority governing their life as their family more than the state in some cultures?

Family doesn't hold as central a position in a person's life from a control perspective in the west as it does in Indian culture. Sometimes sleep paralysis manifests as sort of a dreamlike state, where you see your room or wherever you're sleeping but can move around. Then you kind of wake up from the "dream" and into wakeful paralysis, but not always. Sleep paralysis is weird. It's usually described as being awake and aware but unable to move and seeing hallucinations, but that's not necessarily the entire scope of what happens during an event. [deleted][removed][removed][removed]Oh no :( this hits close to home for me.. I didn't know other people did this. I'm not schizophrenic, but I often find myself randomly monologuing to any hypothetical telepaths that might be listening. Explaining whatever random thing I'm thinking about, usually. It's an interesting experience - it's kind of like rubber duck debugging, but more chaotic because I keep going into asides to explain or dismiss other random thoughts I have.[deleted]Oh my gosh i thought I was alone in this!!! I had always writen it off as once being a super imaginative child that read a lot of fantasy and sci-fi books and just can't shake some of the ideas that I've come across but who knows maybe I'm a borderline schizo just another acid trip awayAs someone who has never been diagnosed with anything other than general anxiety disorder - the 'get out of my head' line really strikes a chord.

I have a very high level of internal 'chatter' and often converse with myself when alone; sometimes speaking outloud. While this dialogue is rarely negative/paranoid, I often wonder who or what I am engaging with.

It is a daunting occurence to relate so strongly with a schizophrenics description of their mental illness (excuse me if this is insensitive/not the appropriate term) without having it myself.Wow I actually do this myself and thought no one else did this. I️m going to try this lolI see you. I know you're in my head. “Er... sorry...” *door shuts; car ignition; engine noise trails off*I do something similar, except I imagine something around the lines of someone having their skin melting, screaming horribly etc. Because it's most likely they can pretend like nothing's happening if I scream "get out of my head!"; however, seeing some awful imagery broadcasted in your mind is harder to hide.Sometimes when I'm alone in a room, I'll say out loud "I know you're listening."
If no one is listening, no harm done. I just said something to myself.
If someone is listening, then I guess maybe they're a little spooked? But unless they reply I guess this system is flawed...People do this?I always do this... I thought this may have been normal. I don't think I'm schizophrenic...You should think about screaming really loud out loud. Do so within a couple seconds of the thought, then see who doesn't react. Telepaths are probably used to internal noise but since they know you'll scream you can catch them based on their non-reaction. Only thing is how to keep them from deducing the rest of your plan.... Would probably need a lot of people.

Just a thought!What kind of thing would we be thinking when we think 'Oh that's bad I shouldn't think that just in case'? First think I can think of is something like the temptation to open a door in a moving car. I think the French call it 'the call of the void.' And then it feels best to put that thought out of your mind in case you cave to it,I think so. Maybe not with as much regularity. Based on my straw polls of friends throughout the years I'm pretty sure most people test their nonexistent telekinetic abilities too. I admit, I savescum excessively in Europa Universalis 4.OCD means Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. Obsess is pretty much what you do. So these thoughts are really common. I don't have OCD or schizophrenia, but I am pretty obsessively compulsive, to the point where I once believed I had OCD. I have ADHD however, so compulsivity and obsession is pretty common there.ADHD, so I'm pretty obsessively compulsive.Hi, Psychologist with schizophrenic father here

Auditory "hallucinations" occur not just with schizophrenia, and can be created by your brain by the way it processes different sounds. But it is a hallmark of schizophrenia. Usually Schizophrenia surfaces around ,18-21 y/o. 

There are a few other things that typify schizophrenia:

Delusions/paranoia
Hallucinations (auditory/visual)
Disorganized speech
Disorganized/catatonic behaviour
OCD tendencies

If you don't have any of the others (other than the sounds you hear). I'd say your fine. Especially since you are older, if you don't "have it" now, you will most likely never get it. 

Schizophrenia is hereditary but its under 10% chance father to son. 

But if it helps ease your mind, visit a GP or a psych, even if you don't have schizophrenia it can be a relief. I always try to take into consideration how much symptoms impede "normal" functioning socially, academically etc. If it doesn't, i'd be cautious going all in on medication or therapy. 

Good luck, hope this was of use. 



When I'm tired or stressed, especially if I haven't slept a much (not major sleep deprivation, just regular couple nights of bad sleep), I'll hear things in the white noise of running water from a faucet, or just background noises. On at least one occasion I was tired, drank some coffee, and while spacing out and feeling buzzed I saw a face in the random texturing of tree bark. I snapped out of it and just thought it was pretty fascinating, but also kind of creepy. If I squinted my eyes I could see it again, at least right after the event. The more I thought about it, the more worried I got, but I have come to accept that my worrying has caused me more anxiety than the actual seeing of patterns in noise.

All in all, the original classical music that I heard in the running water in the gentle hours of the early morning was sort of relaxing after a long night of homework.I've read about the brain trying to basically fill in the blank when there's a lack of input and that would make sense if you only hear it when the fan is on. It happens to me too sometimes but stops as soon as the white noise is gone. Personally it doesn't worry me at all though it's a bit annoying sometimes if I can't ignore it. I don't think it would hurt to at least see a therapist and get some coping skills to help deal with stress and process your experiences.  Psychotic symptoms are often exacerbated by stress, so it's good to be able to cope with stress effectively to avoid a worsening of symptoms.  Having good coping skills and a strong support system is one of the best ways to avoid becoming disabled from a psychotic episode.  

Now I'm not saying you have schizophrenia, but it is hereditary, so you're certainly at elevated risk.  Experiences that traumatize the brain (extreme stress/drug use) can trigger a psychotic episode, so it's best to avoid those things if you can.  Studies also show that people who get treated early have a much better outcome over their life course than people who don't.

Take care of yourself!I also hear soft music coming from running water or a box fan. It's not schizophrenia! It's a common phenomenon that is called Musical Ear Syndrome. These sounds are not of a psychiatric/psychological nature. Here's an article about it: 
http://hearinglosshelp.com/blog/apophenia-audio-pareidolia-and-musical-ear-syndrome/
I grew up in a pretty religious house. My dad died when I was younger, and I always got a paranoid feeling that all my actions and thoughts were being judged by my dad and the man in the sky watching me through some weird crystal ball. [removed][removed]Yeah, this thread is a lot of people thinking they have schizophrenia because they have some common symptoms that also happen to be a part of schizophrenia.Yes. Very much.yeah it does. thank you. its not a choice for me either so i have to focus on the positiveYes! And the thing is even though logically it’s clear it’s not possible, my brain still says that it’s just what I’ve been told my whole life to prevent me from realizing the truth. It’s frustrating. It doesn’t impede my day to day life most of the time so I️ don’t worry too much, but sometimes it gets scary. I was extremely ill as a teenager. Suffered from severe depression and spent my evenings sat in my bedroom rocking back and forth crying while looking above me still because even though my back was against the wall I knew there was something around me. I sang loudly in my head to drown out any thoughts so people couldn't hear them and hallucinated on more than one occasion. 
Edited for wordsmy life has been completely f***ed for a long time and nothing helps It's not that I'm ashamed of them more so that I don't want to let my enemies use anything to their advantage and everyone is a potential enemyOne of the most commonly reported things that people who have a near death experience say is that when they are actually in the afterlife (we are going down the rabbit hole a bit now, I know) the communication is simply done by thought, and all thoughts are heard and understood by the entity they are communicating with.
What if this *hearing and understanding* is a lost or blocked feature of human capability that is somehow unblocked in people like yourself?
There are many extremely credible and serious groups that share near death experiences and they are (for me) a fascinating and wonderful look into how things work (energy, life purpose, continued existence after death and so on) and I think what you are experiencing is a result of you being 'unfiltered' or for whatever reason 'aware' more that yes, your thoughts and actions are not solely accessible to you, but rather are '*heard*' throughout a universal consciousness. I don't think I explained this very well but I know what I mean !

Here's are some links to some NDE material, I hope you find them useful and interesting.

Sorry if this is insensitive, but were you raised religious? And if so, do you think this had any impact? The "moral authority ratting you out" and things never being secret sounds like the feeling I got as a 10 year old in a very religious household, that 'god' was always watching and judging and nothing was secret (not that I'm suggesting it's anything *near* what you go through)Mate, I was just trying to help. I know what it's like to have a mental illness so I've already got a taste I'm not worried at all, and I don't seem to have consequences today. I just wonder what would have happened if I didn't grow up into a stable environment. My environment grew unstable after I grew out of it. Talk to a professional if it really worries you. One psychologist will help you much more than 1,000 redditors.Thank you, thats helful. I'll pass this on.I really liked the dis-order statement.  It made me think.Reddit's favorite superhero. He sure does deliver some parcels of truth.In my opinion, an ideal treatment for mental health would be based on individual symptoms instead of diagnoses. Personally, my diagnosis went from depression to bipolar disorder to bipolar disorder with psychotic features to schizoaffective disorder to schizophrenia (with other diagnoses including ED-NOS, OCD, DID, complex PTSD, and BPD. I would also like to clarify that I have a history of trauma so my doctors were not just pulling things from the air).

Anyway, I was diagnosed with so many things at so many different times that none of them held any meaning to me anymore. Once I had a disorder with psychosis attached, then it seemed like I couldn't be trusted to guide my own treatment. That was the biggest obstacle to getting better. 

For example, there was one psychiatrist who was absolutely hellbent on getting rid of my hallucinations and delusions. At the time, I was struggling with a severe eating disorder that left me passing out about once a week, and when I went to the ER, the nurses there told me I wouldn't survive to my next birthday if I didn't start eating. I wanted to be able to focus my treatment on the thing that was actually killing me instead of the thing that was scaring my psychiatrist. But I wasn't allowed because I was schizophrenic, which *clearly* meant I had no idea how things worked. I had to deal with him fucking with my anti-psychotic prescriptions when I was trying to solve the problem of starving to death on my own.

Most people don't need to be pushed into a box and then treated based on protocol from a book. Most people can tell you what they need, and they should be trusted to know what they need. I'm the expert on my schizophrenia, not some doctor who's seen me for three hours, ever. I believe that mental health treatment needs to take more input from the patients about what we need and what we believe is holding us back. Yes, some people can't articulate it on their own so figuring out their most destructive symptoms might be a team effort between the person, their loved ones, and their doctor.

Ideally, I would like to see diagnoses disappear entirely and instead have mental health treatment rely on a curated list of specific symptoms. Think of it like a Chinese food menu. The current system is like the chicken and broccoli on the menu: made the same way with the same ingredients in the same amounts served in the same manner. Maybe you can ask for extra broccoli if you're lucky. My ideal mental health treatment is more like the lunch special. You pick two from column A, one from column B, and two from column C. Your meal doesn't have any particular name but it's completely tailored to your needs.Here I was getting worried for a second because I used to have those crazy hallucinations every night as a kid. Turns out they were probably night terrors after a quick google search.      
The name is really fitting though, because even thinking back now, about 20 years later it instantly made my skin crawl. I can't imagine having to live with stuff like that in my day to day life.As a doctor, do you think baconbake should consult a doctor regardless of being "high functioning" or not?Yes, most people don't know but severe bipolar (usually Mania) experiences hallucinations. I am Bipolar I and I've experienced a few. To the extent that if I hear or see something I ask if other people have as well. I haven't had any that I know of in about 10 years though. (I can thank medication for that)People who want to know more about hallucinations and how they can be harmless should check out Oliver Sacks' book on the topic.Hallucinations are a common symptom in the general population?!  

Can you amplify on that?Isn't hallucinations and schizophrenia two different things, with schizophrenia having a disjointed thought process element to it too?

Also delusions and hallucinations are considered two different things also?My most beautiful hallucination happened when I was driving home and was on the last 500 feet before my house. All above me, the dark sky suddenly had hundreds of streaks of lilac light falling down like a meteor shower. It looked very similar to [the image in this article](https://science.howstuffworks.com/leonid-meteor-shower-where-when-how-see.htm) except way brighter and all the streaks were coming straight down rather than off to the side.

Most non-schizophrenics know that schizophrenia can be soul-crushingly hard, but few of them realize it can also have moments of breathtaking beauty.Yeah, I have also learned that shutting myself in is the best way to deal with my psychotic episodes. I force myself to stay in my house and mostly stay in bed, then put Frasier on Netflix and just hunker down until it's over. The most dangerous part of hallucinations and delusions is acting on them. But it's incredibly unlikely I'll come to any harm if I just stay in bed and avoid interpersonal interaction.It's definitely good to be aware of psychotic episodes, though, and mention it to your doctor(s) in case there's some serious physiological fuckery happening (like such as a brain tumor or something).> We don't teach children or teens about the mind in general. We don't teach any general mindfulness

THIS. I'm an advocate for mindfulness training, or at least for the idea what mindfulness is, at the earliest possible age. (Sensitive issue is, it has to, has to, HAS to be secular and void of any religious overtones.) I want more people who are content and at peace and don't feel the insane need to buy ridiculous amounts of useless stuff.

I mean, people who sit with their legs crossed usually have a hard time waging wars at the same time, n'est-ce que pas?Great post... but as someone working in Virtual Reality and with a cognitive neuroscience background, I'd dispute this;

>  Our nervous system allows us to experience a very accurate (on the average) perception of the objective world but it is by no means perfect.

In the sense that... we have our sensory equipment and our brains that process that into perception. But it's as distorted a view of reality as one where we look through a kaleidoscope.

In the sense that... a world perceived by a 10 eyed fish with eyes on flexible tentacle appendages - would be as valid a perception of the world as the two forward facing eye version that we're used to.

And that, for blind people, their perception of their 3D environment is again very very different than sighted people - who so strongly rely on our vision that the rest of our sensory and perceptual cues bend to it - while those that have no visual experience... they don't have this perception of the world shrinking into the horizon as a function of distance; they don't even have a perception of straight rectilinear lines.

So... we have a set of tools and equipment that allow us to perceive something of the world - but the objective world itself is somehow much stranger than the one we take for granted.[deleted]This was my experience as well. I have been diagnosed borderline with severe anxiety and depression. The difference in my views and thought processes when I am on my meds vs. when I am not on my meds is extaordinary. I am genuinely like two different people. I thought that everyone felt like they were walking through peanut butter all the time; that everyone was constantly feeling overwhelmed and broken - that is just what life was for me. However, all the other people had learned to "adult" better than myself and still managed to get things done despite these challenges. I also percieved this difference as a weakness within myself. Your comment that "they were just tougher and covering it up better," really aligns with my experience. It took many years but I am pleased to say my doctors seem to have found the appropriate meds for me at this time. Schizophrenia manifests in different ways. In my particular case, my main symptom was thought disorder and my most pervasive hallucinations involved words. In my early 20s, I spent my time in and out of inpatient programs and PHP/IOP, ending up inpatient in something like six hospitals in five states. I had a period of time I was doing ~25h of therapy a week, and I have boxes of medical records backing up my claims.

I can accept that not every schizophrenic is like me, but you seem unable to accept that not every schizophrenic is like your friend. That's completely illogical.It's normal to hear sounds, see things out of the corner of your eye, or otherwise perceive reality incorrectly when you are really tired. It's also normal when you are really hungry, or extremely stressed out, or sick with the flu, or having a reaction to a recreational or prescription drug, or grieving the loss of a close loved one.

The real problem is when it's 4pm on a Tuesday, you're perfectly awake, and then you start hearing things loud enough or disruptive enough to interfere with what you're doing.The most important thing you can do, if you suspect your child is having hallucinations, is treating them as a sort of everyday chore instead of something scary. If you react with frustration or fear or anger, your child will pick up on that and learn that hallucinations are scary.

Treat them like laundry. Not exciting, not horrifying, just a regular thing to take care of. If he believes there is someone outside, you can go to check and debunk that belief, then check again in another hour if he still thinks there is someone there. Obviously, you can't devote your entire life to reality-checking for your son, but you can show him how to integrate it into daily life like any other chore.My medical health professionals have actually helped me learn a lot about my illnesses. They have recommended books to read and given me ideas of things to research on my own. My therapist has also been extremely enlightening and helpful. More information is always better than less. Nobody is going to FORCE medication on anyone, but having others who understand your symptoms can be helpful in times of crisis. May not be full-blown schizophrenia, if it doesn't really impact your life. But it could degenerate into it if you go through a major period of stress. I'd definitely talk to a psychologist or psychiatrist about your symptoms.Uh... yeah, it kinda sounds like it, dude. Get diagnosed by a professional, obviously, but those are all definitely common symptoms.Never once on my life have I ever assumed someone was watching me through a vent, or that a camera was placed in one secretly. I would guess that goes for more than 80% of the people in this thread, and yet it seems to be a very common place and normal thought for you. Think about that one for awhile. Something very different is going on in your head than the vast majority of people reading this I would describe this as "worth looking into."  

If the symptoms have been stable for a while, that's probably good.  But if that changes, it'd be way better to already have a therapist you're working with.  Schizophrenia doesn't mean it's violent or bad thoughts. There's varying degrees and its more a common set of symptoms rather than something that affects everyone exactly the same.

The point is to get help and monitor the condition, because serious life changes/events can worsen it. Right now you're able to accept it and tell the difference, but it could always change.Don't take a redditor's word for it. Don't diagnose yourself. Your symptoms are compelling, but they should be interpreted by a professional before you start considering yourself an actual schizophrenic.There's a whole [spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_disorder#Psychosis) of schizophrenia-like disorders, some of which are milder than others.That is not normal. Something is wrong. See a professional if you can I'm not a doctor so I can't say "you have schizophrenia", but I can tell you that I have never once seen shadow people, heard TVs and people that weren't there, and I've never thought there were cameras in vents. Ever. Most people do not. And I regularly stay awake for long periods of time, so it is not sleep deprivation.

You should seriously go talk to a doctor, because if that's normal for you, you might have some form of schizophrenia.Replace schizophrenia with something else, like heart disease. Just accepting it doesn’t suddenly make it not heart disease/ not serious. I think it's definitely something to mention the next time you see your doctor. I don't know you, but from your comments it's doesn't seem like it's something super disruptive to your life. I would just be aware of it and make your doctor aware of. You may or may not need medication at some point;  just a heads up they can have some nasty side effects. If you are seeing shadow people, that is not a characteristic of a person of sound mindThe fact that you accept it is quite telling. Well yea.. not normal. I mean, none of those things happen to me and I'd freak out if they did. To be honest, I'm not really sure if you're kidding or not, but if you're being serious you should talk to a professional about them just to be safe. No one in this thread can answer that for you.  The reality is, schizophrenic symptoms probably vary wildly in presentation, and it's a condition that might never be fully understood.  

Think about the number of people who have experiences with ghosts or ghostly figures and write them off as supernatural.  Now consider that at least some of these people may be experiencing legitimate undiagnosed hallucinations.

There's likely many people who experience symptoms only when very hungry, stressed, or sleep deprived.

Could you be diagnosed as schizophrenic with these symptoms? Possibly.  But being able to discern reality from the occasional mental quirk means you're probably in a fairly good situation.  It would be a good idea to talk to a healthcare professional.  Many people go through their entire lives with symptoms that will never affect their lives outside of the rare middle of the night spook.  If you ever get to a point where it's more difficult to discern what's actually happening and what isn't, knowing your demons is half the battle.Are you high? If so, then it's probably just being high. 

Otherwise, please go to a doctor, for your own sake as well as that of those around you.A true diagnosis would be dependent on how severely it affects your life. Does it affect your job, your relationships, your ability to enjoy yourself, or to generally function normally? 

Have you ever believed these events or phenomena to be real or have some significant meaning? Have you ever seen a headline or billboard and thought, "this is a sign I that I'm destined to do (something/anything)?

Edit: severity of symptoms varies on a spectrum. You have psychotic people who cannot function outside of a treatment facility and people with mildly psychotic symptomsI don't believe this is necessarily schizophrenia, though I agree you may want an actual medical opinion, not a bunch of strangers on Reddit.If it does not give your stress, I wouldn't start worrying now. If it does, maybe your can learn some ways of coping with that stress, be it techniques or treatments. Stress, my dude, is what we are avoiding.How old are you?My friend told me he'd smoke weed and things would fly out at him and he'd see weird colors. He thought it happened to everyone that smoked weed, but it turns out he's schizophrenic. Obviously, there's nothing wrong with his experiences, but they're not necessarily shared by everyone. As long as things don't get to you, there's nothing wrong with it.There are actually few disorders that cause them, as well as a few non-mental disorders (Fevers and such) I have a different disorder that can have them (Bipolar) 

Over all, I'd get checked out. Even if it isn't Schizophrenia, it could be others or something physically serious or it could be nothing at all.One of the overriding diagnosis criteria is that a condition is affecting ur ability to function. If it doesn't bother u, then it's prob ok. As soon as it become a problem whether you felt it or ur friends and family tell you so, seek psychiatric and psychology helpGet yourself checked, I did.  I ended up having schizotypal-personality-disorder, a mild form of schizophrenia.  The main difference between schizotypal-personality-disorder and schizophrenia is that schizophrenics are bullheaded about their beliefs and no amount of convincing can change their mind. Schizotypal-personality-disorder people can recognize their symptoms and taught to handle it better.  

Some doctors think schizotypal-personality-disorder can transform to full blown schizophrenia if left unchecked with medication and therapy.  They won't haul you away to a loony bin for life if that is what you are worried about.  Most hospital stays last 3-5 days and they will ask you if you want to go voluntarily.  Even then it's only if you feel suicidal or might hurt someone. Forced hospital stays are extremely rare and requires a court order, and usually only if the person is having a full blown scary melt down like is stereotypically shown in movies.  You recognize the voices and hallucinations are not real so the likelihood you will be forced to go to a hospital is almost none. But if you do it's OK, it's more like a temporary school vacation where they teach you to take meds, how to cope with the illness, etc.

The mid-20s is when full blown schizophrenia creeps in.  It's better to stop it before it gets worse. You do not want to wait until it you think you can no longer handle it on your own. > But would it really be schizophrenia? It’s been going on for years and I just accept it.

DUDE just because you accept something does NOT mean it's not a possibility that you have schizophrenia!Please do not "just accept it". It might stay like it is; most forms manifest in adolescent years or early adulthood. But maybe you have a vulnerability - that means the illness could break out under a lot of stress or durg use, f.e. cannabis (Nothing against cannabis, but if the vulnerability is there, any psycho-active substance COULD activate it. Might not, but might.).

It might be linked to another mental illness, it might be some unnamed brain disfunction, it might be something without a name and not diagnosis-worthy, or it could be a mild form of schizophrenia.

There is a spectrum between being "normal" and every kind of mental illness. Hell, everyone has some traits that put him or her close to one diagnosis or another.

That being said, it is indeed "normal" to soemtimes herar something, make something out of white noise. Under high stress a t a new workplace, our room for the staff was above my bureau and I used to hear my telephone from downstairs, albeit mufflet. It didn´t ring.
It is normal to be afraid at night and imagine things.

But it is not normal to see shadow people all the time as well as hearing something that is not there more often than once in a while.

Please get checked.

I don´t know if it is still correct, but the longer you suffer schizophrenia undiagnosed, the stronger it might affect you.[removed]18 hours straight is pretty rough driving - I work in freight these days and we've got really strict regs for our linehaul boys doing the interstate legs.

And afterwards I didn't sleep very long - about 7 hours, and that reset my system enough that I could function until the next evening and go to bed at a regular time.  Dealt with it like jetlag - stay awake as long as you can on that first day, then crash at a respectable hour so you're up and at 'em the next morning.  The body recovers pretty quick.Egads no!  Just because it happened on-campus doesn't mean it was official or approved at all; like those crazy pledge things in US colleges, the faculty would be mortified.Was awake from 9am on Sunday, made it to about midnight on Thurs/Fri.

Then, just out like a light, sudden faceplant into my keyboard.  One of my buddies who was there to make sure I didn't do anything stupid (well, *more* stupid) had to drag me off or I was gonna drool into my keyboard.

Didn't sleep that much longer than usual - up at 8am for breakfast.  I guess the sleep I got was enough to kind of "reset" my system.

I was real shitty though - the campus record was 115 hours.  If I'd made it to sunrise I would probably still hold that record now.  Assuming I didn't die.I've heard my ringtone in a fan when I was waiting for a call, and thought I heard music or something in a softly droning fan or buzzing light late at night. But if I make the fan a little louder the effect seems to go away.I’ve read that white noise type sounds remind your brain of when you where in the womb. When your brain was developing, it was trying to make sense of all the noises it was hearing, including your mother’s voice. Eventually your brain developed to be able to differentiate all the different sounds it hears, and bring order to the chaos. 

It is common for people to hear music or voices when listening to broadband noise sounds (like a fan or vacuum, or hairdryer). Your brain is trying to make sense out of the randomness it’s hearing, and is trying to find recognizable patterns, like voice and music sounds. 

It’s called Apophenia.  We sleep with a noise machine  and my wife says she hears phantom music in it sometimes. It bothers her a bit. It also seems to increase with being underslept, over caffeinated or stressed
http://healthland.time.com/2011/06/13/hearing-things-it-may-be-a-coffee-buzz/For me its classical music. I hear Debussy when i run the tap. Or garbled satanic voices.


I prefer the classical, though. My daughter kept turning her hair dryer on and off because she could hear people screaming at her. I have mental disease and terrifies me to think about her future. Not diagnosed schizophrenic- but longterm pot smoker.
^^ Same. Also often when I have headphones in, I think people are calling my name or yelling at me. It's worse when I'm on my bike, but maybe that's just anxiety about someone trying to get my attention and me not being able to hear them. Sometimes I hear a faint radio talk show when it's silent. However even if it causes me some anxiety, it's not a big deal. I'm glad to hear this is common. Same thing with me with fans and hearing the phone ring. It's stopped since I've moved out of my folks about a decade back and haven't been around a landline.I highly doubt I'm schizo but I will randomly hear stuff like this. Not often but enough I've taken note of it. People yell my name who aren't there, that sort of thing.

More recently since I've been a father of a 5 year old girl I will some times hear her cry or yell for me when she's not actually doing so, or not even in the house. Specifically this seems to happen during a shower or while I'm vacuuming. It's basically just your mind playing tricks on you due to the huge amount of constant and loud obnoxious input it's receiving.For me it is loud noises and being in the shower and thinking someone is knocking on the door.Oh god the same thing happens to me with hairdryers and vacuums! And I hear voices while I’m in the shower, I have to play music while I’m showering because it really freaks me out.I actually believe that sounds played at that frequency are detrimental. I used to play those games all of the time when I was a kid. But something about that damn frequency got engraved in my psyche.

I know I'm not alone either.Occasionally when I would smoke I would hear stuff that wasn’t there, but it was usually related to background noise. Say a shower was going, my high mind would convince me that someone was talking or music was playing. Another time I got really high, back when I first started smoking, and I swear I was hearing police outside my apartment. Not fun lol. I haven’t smoked in a month or two and don’t really feel like doin it anymore...I think this is a somewhat common effect of THC. If I partake in a nice edible before bed, I hear all kinds of things like conversations and music in the white noise from my fan while I'm going to sleep. This happens to me in bed sometimes when I'm tired.That's normal, right? Pokemon music hallucinations were the best because the music was good!For me it's queen. No fucking clue why, I don't really listen to queen that much, but when I get stoned I hear Bohemian Rhapsody, or another one bites the dust etc.I think hearing things when you're high is pretty normal. Freaked me out too for a while but apparently when you're high your brain's pattern-matching function is on overdrive so you imagine patterns that don't exist in background noises and whatnot. Like hearing music when it's just the windHoly shit yeah, I used to hear Pokemon cries at random times. I was diagnosed with schizophrenia a year ago, and never put those pieces together until just now. I thought it was just a weird.. thing?What the fuck, I've experienced this too. Clear as day I could hear the different cries, the battle music, everything. So weirdWhen I was giving birth to my daughter I overdid it a bit on the nitrous oxide they gave me to help with pain relief. In a room filled with bleeping machines, all I could hear was the music from Super Mario World and other video games from my childhood. It was kind of fun, if that's possible during labour.White noise or “fuzz” on a tv scare the crap out of me. I was always Afraid that I would hear or see something I wouldnt normally see or hear. One of the only times I remember having auditory hallucinations was when I had the flu as a kid and kept insisting there was an ice cream truck outside (there wasn’t). It’s kind of cool to find out that’s a common thing.Christ, that's fucking strange!

Damn, under the right conditions, an individual with and an individual without psychosis can hear similar auditory hallucinations!

Goddamn!!Do you tihnk that maybe that's OCD?That sounds the effects of a muse, sir. Maybe you should learn to write music. if they haven't complained about it, I wouldn't worry about it.

Obviously, the frequency should be at a safe volume...There are dozens of us.Occam's razor, my friend.

And I did ask if they had been diagnosed.Yeah same here. Nice to know I'm not fucking insane.WoahHoly shit, I've had this too!! I just googled it and I had no idea it was a thing! The first time it happened to me, it like a shotgun and the first thing I checked was my ears, I was expecting them to hurt or ring, but they were fine. It was like it took place entirely inside my skull. I thought I'd cracked my neck and hit a nerve in the wrong way and went up to my ears. It rattled me for quite a good bit. 

I've had brain zaps coming off antidepressants and it was a very mild version of this. Just googled OMG have totally had that happen. Hallucinations are not nearly as uncommon as most people think. Many people have them at some point in their lives, usually related to stress, anxiety, depression, trauma, etc. Even simply lack of sleep. When hallucinations start to happen so frequently they can be linked together to form delusions, that's when it becomes more likely to be some kind of psychosis or schizophrenia. Had identical diagnoses as a teenager...antidep fucked me up, think it caused some permenant damage, and all withput ever trying anything elseI hate the voice thing. It's always a conversation between two people and I also can't understand what they are saying. I've been hearing shit since I was a kid. My hearing is so sensitive I always thought I had super sonic hearing lolWhat kind of auditory hallucinations? I’m reading through these posts with tears in my eyes. I have so many questions. I’m so overwhelmed. [removed]To my knowledge, they're not necessarily expected as in common, but meds can be an explanation for psychotic features. I take Lexapro and have never had any side effects, but I have no experience with other meds.I have the same depression/anxiety/severe ADHD combo and I've had minor auditory hallucinations all my life. I wouldn't worry about it if it's not causing you distress.Comments like these make me want to say "please see a therapist" and I worry that it will be taken as an insult. But no, seriously. Talk to a professional and tell them about your symptoms. They'll be able to tell you if it's nothing. And if it's *not* nothing they'll be there to guide you through what you need to do next. Schizophrenia is subtle and it can screw up your life so bad if you try to sweep it under the rug, so don't think that it's something you have to idly live with. How old are you? Has it always been going on?

Some people have stuff like that happen and grow out of it. Between the ages of 7-10 I would consistently hear my mom calling my name throughout the day, often running up to her in the house and asking what she needed. Then it stopped. Then again, for a few years in my early college days, I would occasionally hear my name called.

This kind of stuff just happens, especially to people prone to some depression/anxiety disorders. If the hallucinations don't really affect you, you're fine, but if they bother you or interfere with your life its certainly worth looking into. Lots of people are going to react to any kind of minor hallucination with panic or urges to get pills for it, but medication to control hallucinations is NOT a joke. It will really, really fuck with you, the side-effects are worse than the illness if it isn't a severe illness. If its not necessary for you to go about your life, I would not bother.Probably not. Not unless you start hearing voices or becoming paranoid or having other delusions.Not really. I heard it happens to others but it is still far milder than hearing you cat meow at school or breathing...I'm not a doctor, but I'd just tell them how it is. Withholding information from your doctor usually doesn't do you much good.They won’t stick you in a mental institution likely. just speak with your doctor and explain EVERYTHINGI hear ya. I have chronic migraine, so I have been on alot of different neurological/mood medications trying to control it. The wrong one is miserable and disruptive for sure. Plus just that plus the condition plus work/life.  I do think that the danger with some things is that once it goes just that little bit too far, its way harder to deal with at that point. I had to deal with emergency-ish mental health care for an ex and it was very challenging to get done in short time frame. Ever tried lithium orotate? Its got buzz in the nootropic / vitamin circles. Its low dose but might help a little.
Of course we both hallucinated at the same time, the same thing.....
You are welcome to believe whatever you want.I hope your sister continues to do well. It’s always a strain having to worry about people following you and wondering why they are.
Thank you for your kind wishes!I’d recommend seeing a professional. My symptoms escalated drastically from 20 to 24. I wish I had sought help earlier.
If you having any doubts on your sanity definitely talk to a doctor.
Stay safe.She never aged, did she? Also Nash died in 2015, so I suppose she died with him.He's a nice guy if you are a friend with me though. His attitude toward you depends on mine, and is me taken to an extreme I have hypnogogic hallucinations maybe once or twice every 6 or 7 months (sometimes longer) and it's always someone yelling my name *just* as I'm about to fall asleep. I never recognize the voice and as soon as I'm woken up by it I can't remember what it sounded like.This is the first thing on the thread I’ve related to - I have totally hallucinated giant spiders on my pillow by my head at least twice, and full out jumped out of bed, turned on the lights, and dug through my bedding trying to find it before figuring out it wasn’t real. I can imagine that I did, and imagine the feeling of it, but sadly it wouldn't phase into existence. I tried way too many timesHe smiled for the first time in a week He could be helpful on the bright side Kinda reminds me of "It's a beautiful mind." 

SPOILERS

His roommate, etc were all imagined. He went through his whole life interacting with them like normal. He got a job for the CIA as a codebreaker. It was in his imagination. He just found random 'codes' in newspaper articles etc, and delivered his findings to a secret drop point, where they just accumulated because there was no CIA agent picking them up.

It wasn't until the second half of the movie it's revealed he's schizophrenic and he's just imagined all these things. His best friend, the secret double life, a shootout between the CIA agents and Soviets that led him to fear for his life was only in his head, etc. It then shifts tone to him struggling to deal with his condition, reacting to medications, relapsing, etc.That reminds me of the Island movie with Di Caprio.You may enjoy 'River' on Netflix starring Stellan Skarsgard. It's really well done. I think it would be more interesting if it were the other way around. A schizophrenic who actually turns out to have mind reading powers. That's like the show Mr.Robot, I love that showI would watch the fuck out of this.I think you want Legion. It’s on FX.I would love that story! It could bring some insight to how people discover there might be an illness.A very close friend of mine, who at one time I might have called my best friend, developed schizophrenia in his mid-20's. We did everything together in high school, and after high school we got a place together and lived together as roommates for a few years. He drove me nuts and we grew apart. Looking back I can see some of the signs prior to him being diangosed. We eventually lost contact as his path diverged from mine and it took him a long time to accept he needed to take medicine. But I often wonder what it would be like to write a book about our experiences from that time when he started to slip, versus what I recalled. Each from our own words. Almost two narrators with vastly different perspectives but telling the same story, you're just not sure which one is real. It'll never happen, but I think it'd be an interesting premise for a book. Not sure how we'd make a plot though...Kind of been done with Special (2006) 

It's a reaction to medication instead of schizophrenia, and instead of a twist ending it's actually an interesting and thoughtful exploration of the concept. 

But similiar, and really goodMousou Telepathy alludes to that possibility. It's a manga about a girl who can "see" people's thoughts physically represented around her and exploring what that would be like, and there comes a point where the story shifts to her wondering if it's all in her head and questioning reality.

Unfortunately it's shortly after that point that the story kind of loses focus and gets meandery and aimless, but everything up to and including that point is an interesting read. I don't know how accurate it is if we assume the main character can't read minds and actually is schizophrenic though.If you want to see a movie like this, definitely check out Birdman. It was a good movie, but you went and spoiled the ending.Way to spoil the movieNot exactly what you said but extremely interesting. Voices (2014) with Ryan Reynolds. Absolutely amazing.  Dude, write that shit upThis is a good plot Not to be insensitive but I'd love to watch that movie.Like A Beautiful Mind meets Being There. The Revenant Life of Titanic Gilbert on Wolf Island If you haven't watched legion it's sort of like this. Amazing show also.I'll actually start writing it tonight.Kinda similar to the movie the 6th sense I think there's like a dozen tv shows like this.The show Legion based in the X-men Universe has a similar plotline. The main character is an incredibly powerful psychic with telepathic and telekinetic abilities, he was diagnosed with schizophrenia at a young age because he was legitimately hearing voices but never knew about his powers. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legion_(TV_series)It really could be a great movie. And no offense taken from me atleast my friend. Okay ShamylayanSomewhere in the outskirts of LA, an aspiring screenwriter who makes a living by waiting tables and odd jobs is staring at this very comment in their dark room on a bright computer screen.Eh. . .sounds like a pretty forgettable scriptThe protagonist could come from a negative background, and their distrust could be reassured by family members'/ school bullies' mistreatment of them, and as they move on from school, maybe entering the workforce, they encounter a huge company conspiracy by overhearing different coworkers's remarks, only to reach a dead end instead of a big reveal, finding out that the big conspiracy was an in their head.Reminds me of A Beautiful Mind a little bitYou should check out legion on fx. The plot is basically “what if professor Xavier were also schizophrenic” Spoilers but

Prevenge.Movie idea: Schizophrenic who hears voices of people he knows. He can also read minds and has to figure out what's real. A detective movie with a super natural element.Alternatively, as long as we are writing some fiction, an actual telepath who also happens to be schizophrenic.  They would struggle to discern the voices in their head with the thoughts of other people.

Reminds me of the show Heroes.  Some of the people that had super powers also had physical or mental handicaps that interacted with their powers in interesting ways.  There was one woman, a single mother with a multiple personality disorder, who could only use her super strength when under the control of her more hostile personality.Like a reverse 6th Sense almost.Legion is basically the oppositeLegion is a great show with a related concept.It could lead to people vilifying schizophrenia / mental disorders.Watch the "voices" it's an amazing film, probably one of Ryan Reynolds best roles in my opinion but it can hit pretty close to home kind of an inverse of the show "Legion", it starts off where he thinks he's schizophrenic, but actually has super powersYeah. Brilliant, until you realize that thinking you can read minds is a common and often dangerous delusion for people suffering with schitz.theres a low budget film on amazon with pretty much that plot, "How not to work and claim benfits, and other useful information for wasters"O_O

........ *starts writing*It sucked for a long time. I'm pretty good now.I was pretty much "Oh, this makes more sense now."Holy shit I thought the same thing as a child. Sure thing! I have a pretty busy day tomorrow and might not respond right away but I'll get back to you.Nah. I'd rather not read minds.That's the worst. I have decent insurance now that I'm married but before I could expect to pay between a third and half of my income on healthcare and that was ignoring things I probably should have gone to the doctor for. I hope thinks start looking up for you.If it's intuitive I'm not sure it would qualify as hallucinating.I can't diagnose you. I would recommend talking to a doctor.Whatever works! I've written out responses before.I know that some studies are showing the reality testing of people with schizophrenia doesn't work the same. So I wonder if your dad was playing out scenarios in his mind like how people do when rehearsing or rehashing events, but he couldn't distinguish them from reality.Yep. Add the fun of Narcolepsy and you get to confuse conversations you’ve had in dreams too!Are false memories a common symptom of schizophrenia? It happens to me often but i usually catch it because something doesnt make sense.Yeah I think they meant to say the voices in her head?You made the mistake of downloading the latest IOS as well I️ see. I’ve had this quite a few times! I’m sure I’ve heard someone call my name or “hey!” Or similar. I can still hear it in my head and it sounds so real. I’m guessing it’s an auditory hallucination. This happens to me too, but more frequently I hear music. It’s not music/songs I know either, it’s almost like I’m making it all up as it comes. It’s sometimes a choir, a band, different instruments. I do sing and play guitar a little, but that’s something I don’t always do and I can’t write music.Yep, that's exactly like what drug-induced and natural hallucinations are like, at least the less intense ones. They're there but you can't quite put your finger on them! When I'm sleep deprived and falling asleep, the hallucinations can keep me awake sometimes. They just get really powerful so they freak me out, but I know that I'm super tired that I'll just pass out if I wait long enough and stay calm.[Hypnagogic hallucinations ](https://patient.info/doctor/hypnagogic-hallucinations) are largely benign. I get them about 2-3 times a week, tends to be loud music of a kind I’ve never heard before.I've briefly experienced this as well, usually when very tired, I'd faintly hear someone calling my name. FYI this is normal and not indicative of schizophrenia.

Only if it happens while falling asleep Hypnogogic hallucinations! I get them all the time. It's a hypnogogic episode and is extremely normal.Wow,  this has happened to me throughout my life but this is the first time I’ve heard someone else describe it. [exploding head syndrome?](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploding_head_syndrome)  😮 sometimes  right as I fall asleep I hear someone yell loud enough to startle me, or I hear my name, or just a loud crashing sound ... Whatever it is, it scares me every timeI get this a lot. And it's usually when I'm wide awake.Night chatter.And this is why crack heads are so fucking dangerous, the lack of sleep just ruins them.Yeah this happens to me when I'm really tired. Especially when I was a kid. I would never hear it audibly  but rather in my head. It was always a male voice I didn't recognize saying "hey" loud enough that I thought it was in the house but soft enough as though they were trying to keep it down and were in the foyer or kitchen. It would instantly wake me up and freak me out so badly I'd not be able to sleep and worry about getting murdered.

I would be too afraid to move and it was a bit like sleep paralysis (which I deal with often) so I would have to moan loud enough for my mom to hear and check on me she was a notorious light sleeper and always woke up.

I still hear it sometimes but it's usually a loud thump or a door shutting when I know everyone else is asleep. It's always that distant sound that is right in my head. I wonder if it's connected at all to my sleep disorders (sleep anxiety, exploding head syndrome, and sleep paralysis). Yep, I started getting hypnogogic hallucinations too when I was about 15 or 16. They're pretty common apparently and are a sign of your brain attempting to begin to sleep. Is this normal if you're stonedDifferent voices I know scream, shout and whisper my name while I try to sleep all the time. I thought this was a normal thing? I seem to recall reading an article about it happening to most people somewhere. I used to listen to a gun firing or a female voice screeching right next to my ear as I was in this middle space between being awaken and sleeping. I was very tired too. I think that it's something similar to sleep paralysis.This used to happen to me a lot as a kid, either late or night or early in the morning, drifting in or out of sleep, I would think I would hear my dad yelling for me from downstairs.  It's pretty common from what I understand.that sounds different to me than what /u/ghostinshiningarmor described.[deleted]You may think you know what it's like but you should recognize that you're not schizophrenic and you don't know what it's like..It's a little scary. I understand how people could believe they're realNiceeeee I wish my brain was as critically acclaimed as Stranger Things. It'd be a huge boost to my career.The hallucinated voices aren't always evil. This might sound weird but sometimes they're even helpful. Like I was searching high and low for my passport and couldn't find it anywhere. I had almost given up when I heard a voice say, Look next to your bible on your shelf, stupid. The 'stupid' was affectionate I think.

Sure enough that's exactly where it was.

I probably subconsciously saw it. But it's weird that my subconscious 'spoke' to me.I watched my Dad deal for 26 of the 35 years he was diagnosed. You have things just about right.  Dad had days where he could tell which was which, but he also had days where his straight-arrow kid was dealing drugs out of the back of the van, because he heard it. That’s part of the issue though. If your brain sends signals causing you to think or remember hearing a voice just a moment ago, and no one is there, eventually it breaks you down and they just are. They’re real to you.

I’m 32 now and my mother is schizophrenic. She was institutionalized several times while I was a kid, I remember my dad calling to have a crisis team come and take her one night also.

I didn’t know until a few years ago, on that occasion my mom had locked herself in the bathroom with a shotgun. My dad had broken the door off the hinges because she wouldn’t come out and wouldn’t answer him when he tried to talk to her.

When he got in, she had the gun pointed at him. They divorced about a year later.

Every once in awhile my mom still has issues with it even on her medication. Usually with visual hallucinations, thinking people are trying to break into her apartment and “get” her. When I was a kid they revolved more around people coming after myself or my younger sibling.I see what you're saying. I think this guy's video did a good job getting the point across to me that no matter how "real" or "fake" they sound the voices/hallucinations are too strong to ignore. This guy knows he's hearing shit but he still feels an impulse to acknowledge them: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V521Umt1NjUYes, schizophrenics do have rational faculties. Many, if not most schizophrenics recognize that hallucinations are hallucinations. Not all schizophrenics hear negative voices. That's largely an invention of Western society and isn't present in schizophrenics in other cultures. Personally, I'm more likely to hear music or random noise instead of voices. Obviously, I know that there's not a full brass band in my bedroom at 4am. But that doesn't stop the hallucination from annoying me and keeping me awake.

I'm involved in several mental illness and schizophrenic communities, and some of my friends do hear negative voices. Negative voices can be insulting and hurtful and painful and stressful even when you know they're not real. Knowing they're not real doesn't stop them.When the “voices” are heard seemingly from real, present people...dang hard. I live alone. When I “hear” either there, easier to say “not really happening”. But I’m gonna fall back on my “ATM little chance of using reason against” more of a in retrospect thing. I chose the word "many" instead of "most" or "all," intentionally. I believe my original post still conveys your point and stands as is.Yup.Yup. I hit menopause a few years ago and at the point where the hormone levels were dropping, I went through a short burst of hearing people shouting at me and saying my name. At first I was having a minor wiggins over it but once I sussed out that it seemed to be related to the mood swings and all the rest of the shit with menopause, I stopped worrying about it and eventually the voices stopped. Sounded like someone was *right* behind me or in the other room calling my name.. Freaky.No offence meant, but I always wonder: what made you believe them? 

Was it something you'd always lived with and so just accepted as normal, or does the disease blur the cognitive processes such that no critical faculty can be employed against the things the voices are saying? 



Just normal voices.It's like my brain is a classroom and they're sitting by me. I have an idea what they're feeling just like you can tell when someone you know really well has been having a really good or a really bad day. It doesn't affect my own emotions.I don't really know how to explain it. It's like they're separate entities with their own personalities and memories and lives that just ended up in my brain somehow.

In reality, it's probably just my brain's way of compartmentalizing information. But it's still tricky to wrap my brain around.They're significantly better than I am at things. I'm assuming it's things I comprehend at some level because they're real but it's not anything I normally know.

I don't consider it cheating. They're not real, I'm already a pretty smart person on my own, and this whole thing has sent me to hell and back so I feel like I've *earned* this.I can't diagnose you. If you're concerned I'd absolutely recommend talking to a psychologist! Even if you're not schizophrenic there are plenty of ways to help alleviate that paranoia.There are male and female voices. The grumpy ones are all male, though.I have an idea what some of them look like. It just depends.That's fantastic. I'm in a similar boat and being with someone who is patient and understanding has made all the difference in the world. I'm glad to hear you're making progress. Proud of you!Wait, are we Facebook friends? There's two people you could be and if you're who I think you are you're married to my ex which would be the most hilarious person to run into while discussing the nitty gritty of my mental health on the internet.

Y'all are adorable, by the way.[removed][removed]Fuck you.[removed]I am the complete opposite, I honestly can't think of more than maaybe one friend whos parents I would describe as "bad".Seriously, that’s the thing I was surprised by in the post. Most parents would just think their kid was being silly or trying to get attention. I’ve really got to give props to those parents. I hope to be a parent like that. Man, I'm so jealous. Half my face became paralyzed and my mother refused to take me to the doctor because she thought I was faking, even after it continued for 3 months. Thankfully it went away, but I still can't taste with half my tongue. Then there was that time I had a stroke and she got mad at me because she thought I was making fun of her for some reason.[deleted]We haven't  found a relationship between the two, other than they can be easily misdiagnosed as the other (some shared symptoms.) My dad was  schizophrenic, whereas I have ADHD (inattentive). I’m unsure of a relation however an interesting point to note is that stimulants like adderall or Ritalin (used to treat ADHD) can rarely cause auditory hallucinations in some cases.In the sense that you are asking, no. I believe in a way, those with anxiety are more likely to develop depression compared to those without, so maybe its similar here 10000% yes
They’re both abnormal dopamine pathways That is awful. I'm sorry. I would be almost certain they'd rule that out before diagnosing with schizophrenia.  The first thing they'd check is if he were on medication and try changing or eliminating to rule it out.    

No way in hell would he get an actual schizophrenia diagnosis if he had amphetamine psychosis or something similar.  The DSM clearly specifies for Schizophrenia the symptoms cannot be caused by drugs or medications.I have no clue. Not something I've  covered in my quest to understand my dad. Schizophrenic voices are not just their own thinking thinking those things, it feels in some way distinct from their own thoughts.'Intrusive thoughts' which can also be in the form of mental images are a phenomenon related to OCD, PTSD and a few other disorders. Occasional instances of the call of the void can fall under this umbrella, depending on individual circumstance or course. Pretty sure that is normal.  I think what they are hearing are actual auditory hallucinations.  If my voice in my head, my thoughts,  isn't normal I need to see a doctor hahaFrom what it sounds like, it might just be your [inner monologue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_monologue), which is pretty normal.Some people "hear" words in their head when they read or focus hard, others don't. I don't "hear" read words - my brain just understands them as my eyes scroll across the words - but my best friend says/hears them in his head, which we've found makes him take longer to read. Both ways are fine. I can reread this sentence and say the words in my head if I choose to do so, I just usually don't.

Hearing *outside* voices would be a problem - something outside of yourself talking to you or telling you what to do...As far as I know not everyone has that voice, but many many do, including myself. The way you describe it it's probably nothing to be concerned about and completely normal. If you are concerned though, there's no shame in asking a professional just for your own piece of mind.Lol yes, that's your internal monologue. 

Some people claim to not have one, but... I think they might just be a bit confused.That's just yourself thinking. We all do it. That's part of what it is to "think before you speak" or even saying one thing but in your head you think something different. Even in a different voice if you focus on it.

Crazy saying it but the brain is pretty fascinating.That's normal as far as I know. I'm not schizophrenic, but I've had a handful of auditory hallucinations while going to sleep or waking up. These don't feel controllable nor "in my head" so to speak -- it's exactly like hearing something normally. The only way I can figure out they're hallucinations are context clues. 

As an example, once I heard my father exclaim my name loudly as though trying to wake me up. I forced myself awake, but it was the dead of night and no one was there. Another time I heard a very clear, loud Mario coin sound, but there was no logical reason for that.

The one other thing that sets them apart is that it isn't always clear what direction the sound is coming from, at least for me. 
Is there anyone who doesn’t have that lolHard for people over the internet to know. If you're not sure, definitely check it out with a psychiatrist or psychologist. Yup, that’s an inner monologue and most people have this :) I’m female and every comment I read on reddit ‘sounds’ the same in this female voice in my head :) This is normal.

That's your inner monologue, and it can be convincingly auditory.

It's when you hear a similar phenomenon saying things you don't want to hear that it's a problem.
Top KekNot true, but thanks for playing.This. Former Rec Therapist who worked at a psychiatric facility. The way it was explained to me is that mental health is a spectrum, and our genetics determine where we "start" on that spectrum. But environmental factors (family life, stress, social life, drugs, physical health, poverty, etc.) can affect our position on that spectrum.College mental health services got me through a lot! I'm glad you have those resources available to you and wish you the best of luck!I understand what it’s like to Want to understand. If I could have one Superpower, it would be a variation of Ghost Rider’s. I’d like to be able to place my palm to people’s forehead and let them see what and how *I* see. Just for a moment. A moment is all it would take. 
I love entomology almost as much as etymology. I can tell if something has a parallel or basis. Sometimes, it serves me well. Other’s? You get the above scenario. In a Real episode, Any knowledge of my condition goes out the window. Again, like being in a dream and just accepting that things happening Are. No ability to question, worse no concept that anything Is “off”. 
I wish I could explain it in better words. Like I’ve told my friend “human language is incredibly limited as it evolved to Only include words and concepts that are agreed on by consensual acceptance. I wish we’d evolve telepathy already so I could explain myself properly”. You know what happens when a schizophrenic Attempts to describe their experience/perspective/condition with (in my case English) words? Word Salad. It’s not completely meaningless. It’s a desperate attempt to communicate experiences the rest of society Has no terms for. 
I’d like to educate open minded people as much as *I* can. Literally wouldn’t wish the experience on my worst enemy. It depends on the person. I’m on seroquel and without it and another med I would not be able to function. I’ve tried lots of meds and different combinations and with the meds I am now I finally feel normal. It really is YMWV.My doctor gave me a tiny dose to see if it would help me sleep. Even at a quarter of a 25mg pill, it made me a zombie. I can't imagine what it would be like at therapeutic doses. I was on Risperdal, Lithium, celexa, and ativan. All at once, and i was a drooling mess. My hands would shake too, and to this day I still drool. So embarrassing. Seroquel put me out for 48 hours. 48 HOURS. I learned the true meaning of sedation. I flushed everything down the toilet (NO ONE EVER DO THIS) after I stared at the wall in the dark drooling for hours. I couldn't even feel love for my family, I was numb too. And yes, withdrawal was *horrible*. I'd say that triggered the migraines i suffer from todayI had this EXACT same experience with Seroquel about 8 years ago. Every detail of your experience lines up with mine,  except for the pill counting... I was going to just shoot myself. It made me gain a ton of weight too. Glad you made it through, friend.The idea of being off of medication with an illness these days is far too romanticized. I do completely believe that there are terrible doctors that simply throw medicine at people. My wife has delt with plenty of them as she went misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder for 3 years. They gave her lithium, paxil, trazadone, and many others. Never did anyone test her for ADHD until this most recent doctor. Turns out ADHD caused everything that mimiced bipolar disorder, so 30mg of vyvanse manages everything amazingly. 

As a whole, doctors are here to help us, and medication is their tool. My stepfather is the same way. He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, however he refuses to take any medication because he thinks the doctors are just out for money and that nothing is wrong with him. 

If you don't want to take medication for yourself, at least do it for people that care for you.  Hey. I agree with your sentiment, but “you’re going to hurt someone” isn’t constructive or even something you could know. I agree that they should probably continue trying, but I don’t think there’s any reason to respond like that. Some people in here are shitting on you, but as a nurse who's picked up shifts in the psych unit you're absolutely right. It's almost a forgone conclusion that she will either be a danger to herself or others.And his Reddit posts will be used on court to prove he was cognesent of his choices. GL on the insanity plea!Sorry thats false. Actually I'm not sorry. It's a common stereotype that people with schizophrenia are going to hurt people. We're actually MORE likely than others to be abused because of having schizophrenia. *Yeeah*. Sure I'm the crazy one here dude? I'm not going to hurt anyone, I'm good. Not every person with a mental illness will hurt someone, and I'm sorry that you had a bad experience with someone who left this impression.Stress aggravates my illness. I do therapy twice a week, and other exercises for my mental health. I'm answering the question posted, the last few weeks something tragic happened. That's what caused the symptoms to flare and I in turn upped the sessions. Since then, I'm fine. It's so incredibly annoying to be told I'll hurt someone. Mental illness doesn't immediately make someone dangerous. Why the heck would I want to hurt someone? I'm not going to prison lol I'll stick to being afraid to even litter. I'm not going back to being a sick, trembling, drooling zombie to make others feel comfortable. I know when it's time to call in the docs, and I'm good right now. I understand your concern, but I'm good. Loss of libido, numbness, drooling, facial ticks, sedation, unable to concentrate, etc...no thanks. Unless I'm a danger to myself or others which I'm not, I will not go back to meds. In my experience the only response to my above complaints was to add in more pills. I know meds affect everyone differently, trust me I know. Have you ever gone through a merry go round of meds (some of which landed you in The ER) and got more pills thrown at you? The ends justified the means to the docs I've seen. That logically means keep looking for a better doctor right? I kept running into this issue. And believe me, I've no problem going back if I'm truly out of control. 

Look at a few comments I'm getting, literally glossing past everything I've said and immediately focus on "You need meds." What I need is quality of life. I'm used to that making people uncomfortable. But I won't put myself through med hell unless necessary. I saw a doctor last year, and they pushed the same meds I'd been on, the same meds that gave me horrible side effects. I wouldn't hurt a fly. Not every mentally ill person is a walking time bomb. I will not go back to meds. I prefer to live life instead of stumbling through it. Dang son. I assume it's a super low dose but just be careful. Lithium is not something you fuck around with, and even with a formal prescription your doc will still have you come in on a regular basis to monitor your blood levels because it is a toxic substance. It's also not something you can stop cold turkey because your brain *will* be fucked up for a while. How hard and how long depends on the person and the dosage, but this isn't something where you can just be like "oh yeah no problem buddy, Amazon's got you covered!"

Source: had to be hospitalized and then cared for by a family member for several weeks after going without lithium for a *single day*I started out at 800mgs, then increased to 1200mgs. I wonder what 5mgs would do, as I don't have great experience with it, my liver got wobbly. Do not try this. Without correct dosages, your lithium levels could prove very, very harmful to your body. A few weeks ago I heard the most demonic, I mean seriously it was unbelievably loud demonic voice talking and chanting to me. I was terrified. I couldn't make out the words because I was so freaked out. But other times yes they do. I've been threatened, told I deserve nothing, I don't deserve to live, etc. They also will talk through my problems with me, add in what they would do and what I should do. Oh haha. Thanks.They were also far less "cinematic," and more delusional. For example, he declined a faculty appointment at a university because he believed he was going to be coronated as the Emperor of Antarctica. There was research a few years ago that suggested the same connection you just made. In schizophrenics, some of the nerve centers in the brain that are intensely active when dreaming are always active. So, in essence, schizophrenia causes people to be in a half awake state. At least, that was the implication of the paper, more work needs to be done.I was intrigued, as this was when the psychosis was just beginning, and at the time it was still benign (or as benign as psychosis can be). Once shit started getting spooky and I developed legitimate paranoia and hallucinations I could no longer discern from reality, that's when it stopped being interesting. Scariest experience I’ve had with it... I hallucinated one of my friends standing about 10 feet from my bed, staring at me, as I opened my eyes while I was trying to fall asleep. About jumped out of my skin. Then I remembered that friend lived in a different state.I had sleep paralysis and I used to wake up at night seeing a man holding a knife to my neck and being unable to scream or move. He hadn't been around for a while, but came back when I was heavily drugged after a surgery. Good riddance knife man!That happened to me when I had sleep paralysis once. It scared the fuck out of me. I used to experience pre and post dormital sleep paralysis, which is often accompanied by visual and auditory hallucinations.  I usually didn't experience visual hallucinations in conjunction with the paralysis, but one time when I was a kid, I saw a pair of disembodied hands float into my bedroom and try to strangle me.  I remember them looking a lot like the Floormasters from the Legend of Zelda games.I used to do a little too much in the way of MDMA. It is absolutely unsettling when the coat rack in the corner of your eye looks like a hooded man. Or when you’ll find yourself halfway through a conversation with your pals, looking over at your friend beside you only to find they weren’t there the whole time. 

I feel so bad for folks with permanent hallucinations. Makes me wonder how the parts of the brain affected by schizophrenia and sleep paralysis might be similar.Best way I can imagine it is if you watch “Gerald’s game” on Netflix. It’s a short movie but one of the scariest things is IF there is someone lurking in the shadows at night in the same room as the protagonist. I’d imagine that’s how schizophrenia works.This is a very common night terror and is less associated with schizophrenia and more with insomnia, narcolepsy and sleep paralysis. It is a very common and real phenomenon, and it is unclear as to why. 

It is most commonly seen with sleep paralysis, which makes it all the more terrifying for the person experiencing it. As far as strange things that the brain does to you though, this one is classed as "normal". >That sounds scary as fuck. Imagine waking up and seeing some guy at the end of your bed.

I had that experience once years ago... the guy said it was 0500 and to get my ass out of bed.  It was my drill instructor.Huh. I’ve never thought to try that. Maybe I should!They’re usually there for about a minute or so? It would take me about twenty seconds to figure out they weren’t real, back when it first started, now I can get what’s going on pretty quickly.I’m not sure, and I’ve always been kind of anxious about looking too much into it. Like I can deny it’s a disorder if I don’t look it up? It doesn’t affect me too much.It was very funny and I laugh at it now.

Wasn't the worst, when I was younger (about 20 years ago) got some that was spiked with LSD or something.  Now THAT was a trip.  Sitting in the chair when it grabbed me and took off running while screaming because the TV was chasing us. 

My friends said I just sat there saying "run, run, run" lol There's so many mental disorders that don't show up until 18-21. Its amazing that more colleges/universities aren't equipped to deal with this. At my uni, they mentioned a counselling service like once during orientation week, and I'm pretty sure most students didn't even know it existed. The waiting list was also several months long, so if you were depressed or anxious you might have to wait until the Summer to see somebody. They tried their best, because they would prioritize students who were suicidal, and they offered a volunteer-based phone line you could call, but the whole thing was horribly underfunded. Curious here and above if drug use triggered this or something unknown? Or something else? Damn, that must really fucking hard for the family to deal with. Good on them for not putting him in an institution though. Those places can be like hell with the way some staff members abuse their patients. And when your head is already trapped inside of its own hell...I can't even imagineI don't blame them... My father, who suffers from some late-onset form of either bipolar or schizophrenia (he won't talk to a doctor who isn't family), called the Sheriff and swore under oath that I was actively trying to kill myself and had me committed for 72 hours. I'm a pediatrician... I realized very quickly that everyone thought I was literally just delusional, until the doctors actually looked me up and saw indeed I was a physician. 

While there, I was told nothing, spoke to no doctor, nurse, etc. about what was going on and was forced to go without insulin as a type 1 diabetic for 12 hours. As I'm on the pump, this could have been fatal had I not deliberately given myself too much in anticipation they would have no idea how to manage diabetes. 

I eventually stood up, walked over to the glass covered window and just would not stop calmly, but forcefully demanding I speak to someone. So I got to talk to someone and also was essentially told "take these antipsychotics or we'll inject you." I reacted terribly, my neck twisted around and got stuck, I was in agony as I lost all control of them muscles in my neck, head and face. It felt like they were going to pull my skull apart. I woke up 12 hours later after demanding benadryl (settled for hydroxyzine) because I knew I needed an anticholinergic agent to combat the effects of the antipsychotic. 

I could barely keep my eyes open to talk to the doctor who finally came, spoke to me for 3 minutes and left in the middle of a sentence. Later I found out she had filed an application to have my committed indefinitely, I made up a story about being on a hallucinogen binge knowing that if whatever they thought was wrong could be explained by drug use they had to let me leave if I denied treatment. 

If I wasn't suicidal before I was after, it took about 3-4 days for me to wake up for more than 5 minutes. I didn't eat a thing, the hospital sent me home with some antidepressants which I figured I'd try after being so out of it. Huge mistake, I went back in bed for another 2 days. 

It took about a week for me to gather my energy enough to leave my dad's house (where I was staying hoping to get him some help) and I don't remember the entirety of it. The only thing that gave me enough energy was the fact that he kept trying to take my two cats. And, no. Those are my kitties. Once the three of us were to safety I slept for about a week having nothing left after so much trauma. 

My advice for anyone thinking of involving law enforcement (unless you live in Cincinnati), or the justice system in mental health issues is DON'T. Do everything you can to get the people you love help in any other way possible. There are services who will come to your house for free and try to counsel someone about seeking help on their own accord. They can often utilize the same systems the police do, but have the advantage of being able to direct people to facilities actually dedicated to healing the sick rather than nicking a few bucks off medicaid. [removed]Maybe just got into drugs?Have the boy talk to a shaman. Like find a real one and talk it out. They existShamanism could be [EDIT: and historically *was*] a wonderful way for mentally "interesting" people to still be contributing and valued members of their community. I don't know if your schoolmate has found a community that wants a shaman, but he may be onto something.
I know what you mean! But remember “it can always be worse”... Everyone - EVERYONE is entitled to the emotions they feel. It never hurts to be grateful but don’t ever feel like you can’t feel something “small” just because someone else is feeling something “big”. Shoot, your comment hit me like a ton of bricks, I lost my favorite pair of work gloves yesterday afternoon, I was so pissed the rest of the day but reading the responses here are is just sobering!I know that some of the consequences of this condition are pretty bad, but we should also not overly attach negative connotations to it as well. By that I mean seeing schizophrenia through that lense only.

It's a disorder with a spectrum just like many other disorders. Depression can be just as crippling at the far end of the spectrum yet schizophrenia has a much heavier stigma in society. Schizophrenic folks are just folks with a disorder and sometimes it's good to ground ourselves in that reality. Their persona comes first before the disorder not the other way around.

While I definitely feel awful that there are people who suffer these kinds of consequences, it's just that there are many folks under the exact same circumstances from other disorders that have nothing to do with schizophrenia.

As for a cure, well, it's hard to really conceptualize that. Similarly with autism for example. The best "cure" is education about the disorder and proper managementI used to live in a small town where there's a place known as "The Hospitality House."

It has 15 beds of which only 10 are used, and it houses severely affected schizophrenics whose condition either doesn't improve with medication or who can't be trusted to stay on medication on their own accord. According to the director, most occupants have been there for over 10 years and will most likely never leave unless they're transferred somewhere else. 

I had to interview people there for a Psych class last year. The person that I interviewed had been there since the early 90's.There aren't beds anywhere in the U.S. for kids (adolescents 12-18) with these disorders right now. If you know of one, please inbox me. I have the greatest hand me down from god insurance and I can't bribe my way into a bed for my kid to get 6 months of treatment. I'm almost ready to build a wing at a hospital by hand, get a degree, and staff it myself. These places that don't have beds include long term 6-9 month and longer stays. There are families that can not physically take care of their child once they hit a certain point and these are the places that can handle situations like that. I doubt they are pretty but you know what, you have to do what you have to do to save your child's life. 

** I'm a crying mess at the messages you folks have sent. Thank you for your willingness to help.I should always give presciption medication bottles ranks.  That's a cute idea.

"Master Sergeant Propanolol, please report to Lieutenant Viagra."OCD is a still a beast in its own right too though, I know your pain. this is so wonderful you hear. Very happy for her. I just had this conversation with someone, about a psychotic individual living in abject poverty in war-torn country. How can they possibly progress spiritually in such a horrendous situation?

From the outside looking in, it seems intolerable, but for the individual experiencing it, the situation may not be that bad as they don't have a "normal" to compare it to.Me too. I have at least one song, often multiple, in my head at all times.  Even if I’m listening to music I hear other music over it a lot of times. I didn’t realize other people don’t hear this until quite recently when I referred to it in conversation and got blank stares. 

It’s like a radio all the time. I usually enjoy it but in times of anxiety or insomnia it gets very loud and distracting. Lately I’ve started sleeping with a fan on as well as some ambient white noise music and that helps to drown it out somewhat. I definitely hear all the separate parts as well! !!! Same omg. I almost always have some kind of music running through my head, and I've studied music since young + I write stories when I can squeeze time out.[deleted]Paranoia is also a symptom of schizophrenia. I hear cartoony music when I lie down to sleep after an all nighter. Just faint, distant melodiesI do have OCD, diagnosed.  I've been trying different medications for about 20 years. I actually feel like the SSRIs that they put me on are the ones that make the songs worse.  I take 5 different meds for anxiety and ADHD.  I don't know if I need the SSRI, or if it would be a massive mistake to go off of it. I just switched from Prozac back to Lexapro and I swear I've been chewing my nails more lately. I really feel like the Lexapro kicks my anxiety in the high gear so what's the point of it?  But I can't de compensate, in case it is helping depression.  You know what would be great? Is if all of these combinations of antidepressants and anti-anxiety meds were studied so well that they'd be able to say, yep, you don't need this.  It's making you have songs in your head.  I have weird sleep-If given a choice, I'd sleep 6am to 2 pm.  I wonder if sleep does tie in.  Interesting.  Have had 2 sleep tests, they just threw a sleep apnea mask at me even though that has not helped at all and I've been on it for six years now. I think my sleep architecture is weird and I think that they've said I don't go into REM sleep until super late at night so when I wake up after having only five hours of sleep maybe it's as if I didn't really sleep?  And then the music is exactly like a radio in my head, next level annoying.  Now that you said that I think I'm going to take the time to keep a sleep diary.That's fascinating. Probably also a sign that you are musically gifted. I am tone-deaf, my brain could never make up music on its own. I hope it doesn't disturb you too much.Yeah, audio hallucinations caused by white noise are surprisingly normal. I get the occasional thing like this in the shower or when blow drying my hair. A little different, I also get hypnagogic audio hallucinations (basically on the cusp of sleep, I'll hear someone shout my name in my ear, a door slam, someone playing the same short verse on the flute, and for the most annoying, crickets chirping).

Talked to my friend, who is a psychologist-- all totally normal. Most people experience these things every now and then, some often, few never do.He didn't say it's not a corncern, you hallucinated that.It can be a symptom of ocd if they "take over your brain" like op said. It can be a symptom of schizophrenia if you progress from hearing white noise songs to hearing songs or conversations when it's quiet. The point is, if it starts disrupting your life, see a shrink. Why on earth would children need white noise machines? Are your kids autistic? All you're doing is ensuring your kids won't be able to  fall asleep naturally for the rest of their lives. Every trip they take and every person they date will be a problem. You're as bad as those assholes who raise their kids on Ritalin. Not really. An hallucination is generally an entirely internally created construct. What you hear or see isn't there at all, your brain synthesizes it. Stimuli can set them off, but none of the sounds you hear or things you see are externally real or present.

White noise "music" is based on actual sound you are hearing. Most modern white noise is not really natural - it's highly repetitive, the frequencies from electrical hums and the like are different than what you would experience in natural environments. Human intelligence is strongly rooted in the ability to search for and create patterns in information. So it's like your brain taking something that's not quite natural/normal and applying our wonderful human pattern-seeking tendencies to it to try and make sense of it. 

Music is another rhythmic, non-natural sound that we're far more attuned to. So some people's minds, probably those with more pattern-seeking/creating tendencies, tend to resolve white noise into the familiarity of music. I get this quite a bit and never have really worried about it. It's only really a problem when I'm trying to fall asleep but the fan and the AC and the electrical hum are all singing to me and I'm having a hard time tuning them out. It is a hallucination. It’s just not one to be concerned about. It’s normal and quite common. There are actually many types of hallucinations that are normal. Hallucinations don’t automatically mean “crazy” or ill. Oh. My bad. Didn't understand that the first time I read it.


That's a really weird way to end up with sound haha.it's almost meta about schizophreniaSee: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/7cpmd8/comment/dptuva3


Yes. I've tried meditating. I find it doesn't really do much for me.See: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/7cpmd8/comment/dptuva3With getting to sleep, yes. Once asleep, not at all.They are only godsend if they take them and there is no legal way to force them too. Sucks. But at the same time I would never want someone forcing meds on me so I kind of understand. There needs better laws to help family's dealing with it. Yea we didn’t know for a while too. Just knew my mom would be in a mood a lot when we were little. Actually I remember now. Most of her behavior changed after her Dad died. I think that set something off in her. Or maybe that is just a point in time I can reference because of how much it effected me too. [removed]Likewise. Almost hypochondriac when it comes to any form of psychosis.If I could go back in time, I would tell myself to be more concerned for a marked cognitive decline. If you don't know yourself well enough to distinguish between an over active imagination and a strange delusion that you're unable to dispel, then there might be some issues.

And stay off drugs. Seriously. If you are scared that you are developing a psychotic disorder, the worst possible thing you could do is take psychoactive drugs.Don't do recreational drugs. Worst thing you can do if you're susceptible towards schizophrenia.Oh fuck! I was being told that they were going to label me a rapist and a murderer. I would deliberately avoid going anywhere near people (especially women) when walking around, because I just knew that (not really) that the woman I was "following" was getting ready to defend herself from me. I can't imagine what a tweaked out weirdo I looked like when trying to commute.

2015-2016 was like that.Perhaps consider talking to someone? A lot of it could also be your ADHD medication, which can heighten anxiety in some people. Mine doesn't, but it took some trial and error to find it.It gives you an appreciation for solitude. I had a good roommate when all of this was happening, but you soon start to suspect them as well. 

And then imagine trying to tell anyone this and not sound insane or like you've lost control of your mental faculties. It's not easy.For me it's backwards. I'm drained at the beginning of the day, and wide awake when I should be winding down. Depression and anxiety meds can probably will make those symptoms worse. Unfortunately, the best advice that I have for you is to tell a doctor. However, a psychologist, therapist or psychiatrist will have a better understanding because they have specific training in this realm.

Are you worried about how they will react?I guess? I had a happy childhood, but was an odd child in some regards, so I guess I was maybe predisposed to it?

I remember one instance where I used to have pet rats. I was holding one and stroking it, and when I looked down, I saw it had been cut right open down the middle, all the tender meat and muscle exposed. I flung my poor rat across the room. He was okay, but good god that memory stuck with me. 

I used to think I could hear a radio in my room, especially by my bed.. Some soft whispers that sounded like a deep, boomy radio voice. It wasn't a radio.

Used to have to "fight off" Satan with my prayers when I was young. Seriously, my brain is an asshole, so it'd send prayers to Satan constantly, and I'd get locked in prayer battles for my poor immortal soul when I was still a kid. I covered my room with crosses. I kept holy water at my bedside. If the numbers "666" came up in my math homework, I'd flip out and start praying, and then draw crosses on the page. Even my very Catholic mother thought I was going overboard.I feel you on that. A lot of what I'd hear, when things became distinct, was to be incredibly violent, and do awful things to people in my day-to-day. Things I'm not entirely comfortable with sharing.I don't use one currently. I used two at the same time (Seroquel and Abilify) for a long time, but as my life started to get less stressful, and I learned to cope, my psychiatrist graciously allowed me to wean off of them. In another comment I said that part of me thinks it was just an extended psychotic episode, but that's what's there on my records, along with some other stuff.

I'm still grateful for the medicines and the (ongoing) therapy. I don't know where I would be without them.It was drywall! I got a bit bloody, was a bit dazed, but  it didn't hurt much. An old maladaptive coping technique of mine was to hit my head, so I guess it felt natural?

Parents made me (rightfully so) patch it up, but they weren't actually angry with me. Just concerned. I do know that, because I've been in their position for many years with a close friend of mine. I don't ever want to let this hold me back from my goals and dreams, and aside from some instances, it hasn't.Thanks, you too!Whoa. 7 years is a lot. I can’t imagine. I’ve gotten it for like a couple weeks here and there at times in my life when my anxiety got unmanageable, but my doctor was clear that this was not a long term solution. Even after just like two weeks on it, the day after stopping I’d experience like 48 hours of serious paranoia and panic. I’d have to pick a weekend when I was off work, stay home, and just start drinking until it was over. I don’t know if that’s the best thing, but it was intense. Benzos are serious. But they are kind of perfect for individual incidents like flying on an airplane if you’re phobic or just shutting down a panic attack. I wish I would feel magical and special.  :)

Still, that but a smile on my face, so you did spread a little magic over to me too, just by typing that.  Thank you.most of the symptoms of psychosis are normal to some degree if you have anxiety. I have asked mental health workers about it a lot personally because, well, I have anxiety. it's not anything to worry about (as if I'd let that stop me!) If your mental health is otherwise good I really don't think there's any way you have something wrong.The regular feelings like this I had as a pre-teen was definately not from stressful periods, or periods with anxiety... I had a wonderful childhood, especially considering what an awkward child I was (my teen years however weren't that good, but that's when these feelings disappeared).

But... I believe they re-appeared after a very stressful time in my life.  A lot of things went wrong both in body and mind at that point, and I have to say getting the bizarre huge tongue/hand feeling back at that point actually felt a little comforting.  :)  Kind of like a smell from childhood that will remind you of good times.  Hahaha.

Thanks. Sorry, the only reason I asked is because I have had eerily similar delusionsThat is interesting. You don’t hear that name too often. [removed]Thank you kind stranger! What I'm saying is that the whole situation might be a delusion, including the restraining order. Could have a restraining order against him because he waltzed into someone's house.  Doesn't mean that those people had a girl child that was OP's friend.You surely have proof of this restraining order, right? I'm not asking you to prove it to me (you shouldn't). Show it to your therapist(s).

You tell them your have a restraining order in regards to Jane Doe and then prove you have a restraining order in regards to Jane Doe and they literally can't say it's a delusion because it's a real court order.I am disappointed you aren't living in Seattle because I was gonna say, I swear I know that schizophrenic Russian lady.  Half the time I see her, she's mumbling to herself in a thick Russian accent.  The other half, she's completely lucid with no trace of an accent at all.Sorry I couldn't tell you. If you are schizophrenic it can be next to impossible to know how long you've been out. I literally can watch an hour of tv looks just as real as anything just to be told I was staring at a dot on the wall and laughing for that hour. It's hard to know what's reality with this disorder. If you are worried though you can and should see a doc.I am terrified reading this whole post but I can't stop. I feel like I'm getting some great insight to other's lives. Lol. It's stressful.Stuff You Should Know did an episode on this:

https://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/podcasts/what-is-exploding-head-syndrome.htm

Can I ask you a weird question? Do you ever wake up to that voice?

for the last couple weeks, when I wake up, I very clearly hear someone saying my name. This morning, the voice said it in my roommates voice, but she was already gone for work. 

Well... sometimes its not my name. But its there and it sounds very real. about a week ago, it didn't say my name, but it said something like "Its over now" and it had me on edge all day.I'd recommend talking to someoneThis has got me wondering if what I'm hearing is actually something other than my imagination or bad ears. For years I've had this issue with hearing someone shout my name while I was concentrating on something or when I was falling asleep. 

I just chalked it up as me hearing a noise or something and my brain trying to make sense of it by "filling in the gaps" so to speak. Making sense out of nothing. Kind of like that optical thing where you can swap the letters around in a sentence but still read it. I think you should speak to someone, OP. 
There’s no harm in it! 
Wish you the best You should talk to someone. Don’t freak out about it, but definitely talk to somebody.Did your parents talk to you that way? That seems to be exactly how it usually starts. :(Of course it's your mind playing tricks on you. It doesn't matter how loud it is it's a sound that doesn't match the reality around you. If it's something you can put out of your head then you should, if it's not then you should talk to someone. Insulting or derogatory auditory hallucinations are very common in thought disorders such as schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. If I were you I would see a doctor, better early intervention than late! >I don't know if me mind if playing tricks on me.

Well, that's pretty much what schizophrenia is ^imsosorryTalk to someone, go to an expert. It's probably better to catch it early than to wait until you're putting cigarettes out on your bare feet.Since voices don't come from nothing, it's your mind.  I never understood how people can't tell something isn't real when it clearly can't be the consequence of a self-consistent reality.  But then, look at the American electorate...> schizophrenia

check this out: https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/4z74as/low_dopamine_symptoms/Well, if your room is •actually• full of demons, going back to sleep is probably a course of action as viable as any other. On the one hand, I'm very sorry that happened to you because that's one of my worst nightmares. On the other, I'm so glad that if it did happen to me, it would be painful and not something I'd take a long time going to the doctor, for.

Edit: words
plz dont do this to me...I will never sleep again thanks. I've been trying to research this more lately. Im also a cisgendered woman and a lot of my dreams I am a male.Sometimes in my dreams I'm a large black man. I'm a pretty average sized white woman. 

I mentioned it to a therapist once and he figured that was my inner self. Also hilarious, I could be the butt end of so many white people jokes. I got a new therapist. She's less a dream theory person and suggested our brains just bring together a bunch of things from our life in weird ways. It's so often a large black man probably because my godfather is a large black man and he was like a lifeline to me when I was growing up. 

I think what I am saying is that you may not have to worry about that symptom alone. But if you are having multiple symptoms or are even just unsure for whatever reason at all, it's probably a good idea to talk to someone! I started out by just going to my doctor for my depression and then she did some basic tests (including medical ones, which is good!) and then referred me for the therapy. She gave me the option of managing my meds through her, with a psychiatrist, or with both. That was nice. I stuck with her. 

Uh oh...Well, I'm not quite there yet but getting pretty close.Until you hit the second peak in your 50s-60s anyway!It's a bit later for women too. More like 25-27. No, he’s a sensitive person, despite his bad-boy exterior, and that would have been too much for him.No no no, I’m married to someone else![removed][removed]I wish I could have seen the commentSure, but where to begin??


I suppose I'll start with Heather, because that's the part that hurts the most, and I really miss the time we shared together.


I was in a transition period of my life. I was breaking up from a 2 1/2 year relationship with a wonderful woman, mostly, because she wasn't artistically/intellectually stimulating enough for me, and so I just made a prayer to the universe.


I asked for a woman to come into my life that I could share my love of art, music, philosophy, and bohemian culture with.


Our relationship started with a hug.


I was bartending this dope af hippy-bar/music venue, and she came in to get a beer, but she looked so sad that I asked her if she was ok, and if I could do anything for her, and she looked up at me, and asked for a hug. I'm good at hugging, and I just held her for a bit. It was really nice.  :)


I already kind of knew her because I was friendly acquaintances with her previous boyfriend, and the three of us had smoked weed together a couple times, and they were regular customers of mine, but I didn't know her very well at that point.


Over a few weeks I saw here more, and more, and we had some good conversations. I learned that she was studying art history in college, and she danced, and sang (beautifully), and played violin. I kindled a small fire in my heart for her.


One day we were hanging out at the hippy-bar after I got off work, and she said she had to go back to her place to do laundry, and the unasked question of "would you like to come?" hung in the air.


I had nothing else to do so I rode over to her apartment. She put some laundry on, and we settled into the couch to watch a movie together. I don't recall what movie, because honestly, I was paying more attention to her, but knowing her as I do now, it was probably a Miyazaki film, and then...


She pulled me close, and passionately kissed me.


That was the moment I fell head over heels in love with her.



I had been casually flirted with, and both subtly, and directly courted by multiple women over the past few years, but none of them set my soul ablaze like she did. Our early relationship was more akin to a fairy-tale romance than anything else. Pure Majic.


I was really into DJing at the time, and searched for new music constantly, and for about a month solid I'd find a new love song everyday and send it to her. [Stuff like this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSMNJuXK_3I)


(That song still makes me tear up listening to it, because of what it means to me.)   :/


Anyway, I was living with another woman who was kinda courting me. She was a DJ, and Yoga instructor, and we were pretty good friends/roommates until Heather came around. They didn't like each other, for obvious reasons.  Me and Catlin still got along pretty well, but there was always tension in the apartment when they were both there.


Around this time I found a hack for a DJ program, and had made friends with some industry insiders, and so I was working really hard on getting a job in the DJ equipment industry. And because of how obsessive I am, I had a nervous breakdown. 


I wasn't eating, or sleeping much at all. Just working on these programing problems day and night. Heather was so worried that she would fix her special spaghetti recipe, and bring it to me while I was working because she knew I wouldn't eat unless someone forced me to. It was rough times, but still quite beautiful.


Eventually, because of my mounting paranoia due to not sleeping/eating, and just working day'n'night, and my close connections with dealers... I ended up in the local psych-ward so emaciated that when I had to disrobe, the nurses audibly gasped because my bones were sticking out...  :/


I had a really nice moment in the hospital when they brought a therapy dog in. It was probably the only time I actually felt "safe" in quite a while, so when I got out, Heather had gotten us a nice apartment together, and insisted on getting a dog. That turned out to be a very wise decision. Freya is my therapy animal, even though she was never really trained as such, but she's been really healthy for me, and I love her like my child. I wish Heather could see what a good dog she has grown to be...


[2014]


So I had gotten my job back at the hippy-bar, and after a while, started working on my hack, and had another breakthrough, and several others because I was studying electronic engineering in my spare time. Coming up with shit like "Spray on Television".  I knew that if I pulled this off we would be set for life, and I really wanted that for us. It was exiting. I recontacted my industry friends, and just worked on that shit day and night... again...  :/


I poured every ounce of myself into the project of saving us (as a family), but it wasn't enough... I wasn't strong enough...


No matter how hard I tried... It was never enough, and I let our relationship slip in the process.


[Vince hangs his head in remorse.]


I didn't have time for a deep relationship, because I was trying desperately to save us both, and so our relationship soured.  :/


Honestly? Our sex-life was never that good. I guess we just weren't very compatible in that sense.  My ex and I had a wonderful sex-life, and this just never compared, and furthermore, at that time, when we'd make love I'd often spend a lot of the time trying to solve programming problems in my head... I just couldn't get my head out of it, and I feel really bad about that... honestly.


And then the paranoia builds.


This was exacerbated by my friends intentionally fucking with my paranoia because they thought it was funny. I've had multiple conversations with close friends where they admit that they were just fucking with me... I have PTSD, and a severe distrust of people because of that, and I have a really hard time even going out in public because I don't trust anyone anymore.


I'd been noticing these strange problems with my computers for a couple years, and it just got worse. The paranoia built, and compounded, and broke me.  Completely broke me. Shattered me. Destroyed me.  I can't even hold down a steady job anymore, and I've spent almost 4 years basically completely alone.


I'm trying though, I'm really trying to get my shit together, and get back to living a semi-normal life. The SLS has helped me a great deal in that respect.


[God, it makes me so depressed to talk about...]


Anyway, that's just the bare bones. I'm happy to answer any deeper questions you might have.



----------------------------------


[*Be Love. Be Free*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZNqMt3QbC4)During the episodes, I rationalized it with the knowledge that I would have moments of lucidity, as strange as that may sound. During that time, I was still a Christian. I believed that if I honestly repented, truly regretted my actions, etc., the Bible says that (almost/pretty much) anything can be forgiven. Because I recognized that once I was lucid I would be devastated by my actions, I knew I would "repent" and thereby gain forgiveness. The dual-sided nature of this is somewhat confusing.

The homicidal ideations came with intense euphoria. It was terribly addicting, which made it far too easy to slip back into that mindset as soon as I was tempted, even when I was in a state where I _didn't_ want to do those things.

There was also a sense of atheism of a sort mixed in. The thought process was something like this: If there is no God, there's nobody to punish me in the afterlife. There are serial killers who went 30+ years without being caught. I can avoid making the mistakes they made, and if all goes according to plan, I won't be caught. If I am caught, it probably won't be for that same 30+ years. I'll have lived this life normally, without consequences, plus gaining that extreme euphoria. There's no downside.

No downside except basic morality....

It might be a sort of subconscious-conscious leak or something; normally, we'd see a situation and have presented to our conscious mind either A) a requirement for more information, B) a set of possible choices, or C) a conditional set of choices dependent on the variation in the situation as new information arises. In this case, one might say I am instead presented with the discussion of the subconscious, and from there my conscious mind processes the information and observations to come up with those choices "on my own".

I hope this can help you with your thesis. Good luck.It seems really likely. Just about all of the founders of religions have "visions". I was mormon and was taught that the founder, Joseph Smith, saw things all the time. Maybe he was making it up or maybe he had a mental health problem. I would lean towards making it up, though, since I think most people who have issues like mine don't function very well in the real world. That is using your imagination to take back control of your mind. Keep doing it. It is sort of like programming a computer and giving it op codes etc.[removed]Ah man thanks so much for your advice. I'm more
Of a manic depressive though. Up and down every minute and I don't like the thought of taking medication. Unless it's recreational haha but I would if it got worse. It's your friends and family who suffer too. 

But exercising and eating well. Whenever I do either of these I feel much better! Especially exercise. I get agitated really easy if I don't. 

But again! Thanks so much for your advice. youre a good man! I wish you well too. If you ever need anything advice with anything ... just message ! 

Peace out my dude. It's just sadder for me, personally, that all this outrage amounts to essentially zero change that is literally killing people and ruining lives, because we're once again just ventroliquist puppets for social and political issues, and disposable pawns to be used until we're no longer usable, and then replaced.

It's deeply ironic that we can overthrow governments, can establish a military state under martial law because no one in America could stop us if we decided to take over, and we're all in the combat services well-trained killers, but all that power to fundamentally change the world and we're just this powerless.

Probably because a lot of us see the shitty end of the foreign policy stick in theater, get daily experience enmeshed in terrible government functions, and shed enough blood and have to bodybag our buddies that we just don't want to be part of America anymore once we're done.
Funny you mention that, I was in Denver with the same girlfriend as the one in the story and she went to go try picking up some Weed at a dispensary since it'd be our first time legally purchasing the stuff. Someone there recommended CBD stuff for me too and said it might help the anxiety. We purchased some but at the last minute I got cold feet and said I'm scared I'll panic again. I was actually already suffering from anxiety from altitude sickness, which is an entirely different story. So I was worried that the altitude sickness combined with Weed (CBD or otherwise) would send me for a spin. I remember even smoking a cigarette up there made me feel very uncomfortable. Altitude sickness is no joke, friendo.Certain medications are famous for making people feel like a zombie, the most know one to do this is called Zoloft. ive had my own experience with it it definitely made me feel like a zombie. Now I seem to have the perfect balance of meds that all work out. So i prefer to take pills obviously, if i don't the side effects of them "wearing off" are really hard to go through so its kind of a reminder to take them if i forget.So true. Thank you kind soul for scrolling this far. Thank you very much for sharing your experience and for your advice. I appreciate it very much 😊i see no harm in asking someone the meds that they have found that have worked/ not worked for them. i know how a doctor works, thanks though! When I get bored, I get sick to my stomach. Nauseous feeling, like I ate something bad. No burping or gas, but a few steps below puking.At least you know where you're at and where you want to stay. Not getting jumping up and down excited is something that kinda comes with getting older also. Candy as a kid is amazing, the candy you occasionally have as an adult is cool, and everything else works that way too. There will be things that excite as you get older but they get fewer and further between. So you still get these crazy hallucinations? Are you aware at the time that they are not real? If so, does that not really lessen the trauma? I can imagine knowing on some rational level it isn't real but still being absolutely terrified of it and having ptsd I would see these thing again.Actually visual hallucinations are far more prevalent than you think and you dont have to suffer from schizophrenia to experience them and there are a lot of overlaps on what people will report to see, the majority fairly harmless.

https://youtu.be/SgOTaXhbqPQ Maybe it does but those people don't seek help because it doesn't bother them :)Not insensitive at all. My boss's husband has seen hands too. She told me he's sensitive about bringing it up but she had to get rid of a specific hamper because he kept seeing hands pop out of it at night. This actually made me feel quite sane to knowIt does indeed. Thanks for talking to me about it. Very fascinating subject[removed]You sound nice, i wish you luck with your studies. My sis is an ER doc and the world could use more people like you and her.

Cheers.Can I just say reading your well informed and well written responses has been a joy? The world will be way better place with you as a doctor. Thank you for pursuing it! Bipolar disorder runs in my family so I know what you are saying about the continued stigma of mental illness. Society will get there one day, hopefully. so uplifting to read informed, balanced contributions like yours. appreciate you sharing your knowledge and experienceYou seem to feel strongly based on the past six comments, I'm happy to post a little photo. I can see from your post history that you don't have a completely positive view of people with schizophrenia, and I'd like to help change that. This really makes me think about my family and personal history... I️ also have a family history of mental illness and autoimmune disorders on my maternal side... I️ have severe ADHD and generalized anxiety disorder, as well as migraines, Reynauds syndrome, and multiple forms of synesthesia... I️ wonder how many of my strange experiences might have actually been in my own head...
(Cognitive psych/neuroscience PhD student, btw)> strong family history of schizophrenia and autoimmune disorders

Oh wow, this is fascinating. There seems to be some sort of ADHD/ borderline personality disorder thing in my own family, along with Graves disease........probably just a coincidence, but interesting if there's a link, this is news to me.There’s something about the way you describe your experiences that I really appreciate. It’s hard to explain exactly, like standing before something vast or immense, you don’t see everything but you can feel it. Your perspective and perceptions are stimulating. Sorry if this comes off as strange.Hmm, that is very interesting. Yours is certainly an atypical case, as is the preponderance of female cases in your family. It is normally much more common in men, as I'm sure you know. I'd say autoimmune involvement isn't out of the question in your case at all.Thank you for making me aware of autoimmune encephalitis! It may explain something I have never been able to explain.If there's one available to you, it might be worth it to talk to a genetic counselor. Perhaps they can look into the possibility of encephalitis/schizophrenia from a genetic standpoint for you.

Nb: I realize that genetics here plays a very complicated role, which is why I recommend a genetic counselor, rather than a regular geneticist, if there's one in your area. They can tell you better than I can if genetic testing would be beneficial to you.There was this woman who was quite different from the other patients with psychosis and she had Sjogrens too!! Are any  psych disorders linked with lupus and gut?Have you gone down the rabbit hole of increased intestinal permeability (Leaky Gut) and the role it supposedly plays in causing autoimmune disorders and systemic inflammation?Hey fellow sjogrenite! Wrong address buddy, you mean the person I replied to :)I would recommend otherwise. Went through very similar circumstances with AHPRA ( however different mental issues ). In my experiance with them they always look at it more positively if you self report and are honest, than if someone down the track ( like a disgruntled employer/colleague or your mental health practioner who feels like your putting the public at risk) reports you. That is when you will really feel their wrath. If you self report you can normally resolve it with minimal hassle, even if they will keep updates and regular meetings with you to see how your going and to ensure your continuing to see your mental health care provider and continuing the medication your meant to be on.Very interesting!  Thanks for the info.I'm happy someone else even knows what it is!!! I've had DOCTORS tell me I am making it up because I don't present in normal fashions. (Mine is exacerbated by stress, concentration, or anxiety. If I am calm, its not EXTREMELY obvious unless you creepily stare at me for several minutes and I am easily capable of doing the tests)

I feel like I am constantly going insane because no one believes me about any of my problems. I'll bring them up to doctors and they get utterly ignored or told to deal with it. A manager told me "I lied about being able to do my job" my boyfriend told me "It's all in my head" My family all thinks I am psychotic. I constantly feel alone. Being "Unique" isn't fun anymore. :(But how can someone with visual hallucinations be a competent doctor? What if you hallucinate symptoms in your patients? What if you're trying to read a chart and it starts multiplying like the note on the wall that you mentioned? Wonderful. But expensive It's called premed hq, which is hosted by Dr. Ryan Gray. It takes you through premed, med school, residency and beyond. I think it's the best premed podcast out there.Bless ! Oh ok, thanks for sharing.That ‘front palm’ is called the ball of your foot. That is where my brother (who has autism) walks mostly too. Some children will walk like that, others right up on their toes. I say children only because I worked with children with Autism, and haven’t known enough adults to comment on trends. My brother hasn’t grown out of it though. He goes through shoes a lot, typically they break with a deep crack across where the ball of his foot would be. 

I actually used to walk the same way as a kid. Never noticed until these group of girls pointed it out in high school, maybe year 8. They asked me why I walk on my toes. I didn’t think I was walking any differently to anyone else, so I had a look. Sure enough, I was putting my foot flat on the ground first, then springing up on the ball of foot. Once I noticed, I made a conscious effort to walk heel to toe, and after a month or two I did it naturally. I wonder if I would have bothered changing it if I found out as an adult rather than a self conscious 13yo. > They would shuffle around and always had their arms bent like dinosaurs. 

The Thorazine shuffle.Lol, I'm sorry I'm not laughing but no no dinosaur arms. A lot of people become zombified on antipsychotics. Mine have made me habitually pucker my lips like duck face, and one did have me drooling, one made my leg super, super stiff and painful like I had a bad limp because I couldn't really use it. That's one reason a lot of psychotic people prefer to just suffer the disorder than be on meds.Oh I'm a full blown schizophrenic so do and have done strange things. I had to walk a certain way or I thought a stranger would like stab me, or someone would be mad at me. I've had paranoia and typical schizo symptoms. I can't remember anything right now, my memory is bad but I've had a lot of symptoms. Do you have anything else you'd like to talk about while you feel you can?Isn't that what we just did? ;) 

I also was pretty worried my parents (more so my mom) had been killed and taken over by people somehow wearing their skin. 

Overall I did have a very happy childhood though so I guess it didn't bother me too much. I also grew up in catholic school! I think that's what started it I don't mean you nore everyone, but coldren fearing hell is not rare in families which indoctrinate their children.Medication helps me a LOT. Not perfect but makes me function a lot better. My medication stopped working after a number of years, and i was a mess while switching meds. Also had postpartum depression, and my OCD got out of control. Upped my dose. Ocd is a real bitch. Im glad your sister has gone to therapy. oh yes. hes definitely being seen. i have been fighting for around the last 8 years for someone to listen in the medical field. was always dismissed as childish imagination. which annoyed me because he never played with toys as a small child or did imaginative play. 

Now he's getting older and more willing to talk about things he's currently being seen by early Intervention in psychosis team. They haven't said what it is he is suffering with yet but at least he's finally being assessed. Sorry I took so long to reply. Other things I feel would probably be depersonalisation. (Or something like it. It’s really difficult to describe but unlike many others, I hate the feeling so much.). With depersonalisation, at good times, maybe once a month or so. Bad times, most days for I don’t know how long, maybe a few seconds to a few hours. The feeling is so difficult to describe that I honestly don’t have any words for what it’s like.

I do have a few other examples but I’ve been fairly busy right now (Note that symptoms that I have described are not new at all, it’s been like this for a few years but getting worse in the last 6 months)I understand why you are saying that but I’m really not sure who at my school I could talk to. As well as that my school is religious (I am not myself) and I am scared that talking to them about that because of the feelings that I described. I have been trying to make small steps and finally am building the confidence to talk about it to someoneWell, from my experience, some of my episodes were harmless. Just annoying chatter or like a bad reception from a radio station. At its absolute WORST, this thing that I manifested I really can only think of as a demon. I was trying to sleep on the couch (because someone was breathing under my bed, you know) and I heard footsteps come down the stairs. I watched the staircase with no one on it but heard every creak until "it" reached the far end of the couch. "It" was telling me it was going to rape me, and despite my bringing my legs to my chest and laying in a ball, I FELT something inside me. That is the most fucked up part, really. When your brain actually makes you feel the pain or sensation. I could actually feel something being inserted into me, but there was nothing and no one there. It was horrific.

Now THAT definitely stems from an underlying issue that I haven't dealt with.. but I don't really know why sometimes i felt puppies crawling around on me and nuzzling me, and other times I literally felt the sensation of being raped.

The brain is absolutely terrifying.But Science does answer the "Why?", "Why does electricity flow from one point to another? Because of the difference in charges at the two points, generates a potential difference, or voltage", it answers the "What?", "Why?" AND the "How?" (Go easy on me, I'm a Physics student).That's the thing about it though and something I struggle with regularly. Science can't always answer why. Like why are we here? The way I see there's two possibilities. There is no why, it was a complete accident, a one in a trillion chance, evolution of the human race was a 1 in a trillion chance and then all your ancestors somehow met to lead to your parents, your parents somehow met and you just happened to have been the sperm, another 1 in a trillion chance. You live to die without even the memory that you ever lived at all. Or there could be some kind of creationist. But then where did that come from? Whether you believe in the Big Bang, a divine being or both, all leads back to the possibility that something came from nothing, and that bothers me greatly. My mind can't grasp the infinite possibilities and trying to contemplate a vast endless darkness where even the universe itself doesn't exist had the Big Bang never happened at all. Where did that one little spark of life come from anyways? Science could never answer why. Seems like a shakey argument.  If you dont know the nature of existence, how do you know that you could never discover why?Even religion can't explain "why," for example, God did what he did/ does what he does. 

Why did dinosaurs come first? Why is the rest of the universe so completely empty? Why does general relativity break down at the event horizon of a black hole? Why is pi infinite? Stuff like that.

"Because God is mysterious" doesn't answer anything. Brings us back to "why."[removed][removed][removed]I've met so many ~~stronger~~ stroke patients in my line of work that I just take it as a given that I'll have one some day. I often think, "When I have my stroke, I hope I get to the hospital quick/ I end up with x deficit over y/ I've got a a good support system so my life participation doesn't decrease dramatically".

Isolated cerebral vascular accidents scare me less than degenerative conditions. With the former, you can adjust to a new level of functioning. With the latter, it's always changing. It's like swimming against the tide.omg, Alzheimer's scares the BEJEEZUS out of me!! Runs in my family, the women just get decimated by it. The thing is, many people who haven't been around Alzheimers think it is just loss of memory. But the hearing voices, seeing things,,and endless paranoia are the worst symptoms.

My grandmom used to constantly ask me about 'those bratty kids in the living room." She was 100% convinced that she could see them.  If you attempt to explain there are NO kids jumping on the furniture or whatever, the Alz patient begins to get suspicious, wondering why everyone is 'lying' to them.  My God, it was the saddest thing I have ever seen- watching Alzheimer's slowly destroy someone.

I have been thru some wretched things in my lifetime, but I never seriously considered suicide.  An alzheimers diagnosis would do the trick though. I can't imagine putting my family through that
I'm terrified of Locked-In Syndrome. The possibility of being completely helpless and unable to communicate is the stuff of my nightmares.Look up prions if you ever want to terrify yourself some more. I don't like to think about prions.Yeah, I'm pretty close to a degree in Neuroscience. Fucking terrifying how easily something can go catastrophically wrong, yet weirdly reassuring how resilient the brain is.

I also worked in an assisted living facility for a while. Dementia and Alzheimer's always scared me in a way that crazy monsters scared me. Scary sure, but neither felt real. There was this woman, I forget her name, resident of a few years. She was very friendly, loved chatting, and had been showing early signs of Alzheimer's for a few years, but it seemed to be progressing very slowly and she was still quite lucid with good memory.

Over the course of one week she went from that lively nice lady, to almost completely catatonic. She would barely respond to questions, she needed to be fed, bathed, clothed, basically everything. The woman we knew was essentially dead, and she was transferred very shortly after as our facility was not equipped to deal with someone at that stage.I was recently reading up on chronic traumatic encephalopathy. It's a terrifying condition. It can literally completely change your personality, in many famous cases, turning the afflicted into violent murderers. The most frightening thing is it can only be properly diagnosed once you're dead and they can slice your brain into thin slabs.My grandpa had dementia. It is something I would never wish on anyone no matter how much they wronged me. His  “person” I guess is how I’d describe it was gone. It really hurts thinking about how he’d forget details about his daughter (my mom) or his son’s life. Thankfully he never, ever forgot his grandchildren’s names. But if I ever get diagnosed with it, I would rather die.Agreed, their comment rubbed me up the wrong way. I don't have schizophrenia, I have bipolar disorder instead. Having bipolar is my normal, I don't have this comparison of how things 'should' be. I know healthy and unhealthy, but those all fit within my bipolar spectrum. It is part of who I am, for better or for worse.

Some really positive things have come out of being diagnosed and receiving treatment, it's not a death sentence. It doesn't mean it's easy, but it doesn't have to rule your life. 

Schizophrenia used to scare me, but the more I learn about it, the less it does. It's amazing to see how people cope with it, it's such a different condition from what I experience. Education is so, so important.What about his comment made you assume he knew anything about schizophrenia?  Maybe instead of calling the guy an asshole you should educate him/her.  People in general are very uneducated about mental illness, especially conditions like schizophrenia.  We see the extreme examples in TVs and movies, and unless a family member is affected we don't see what living with it is really like.  Threads like this are educational opportunities, and while every should remain empathetic, you have to remember that people are generally ignorant of things that don't affect them in their daily life. [deleted]I have no words  or deep great insights. 

I guess I've always presumed, because of movies and what not, that mental breakdowns were like a one day thing 

IOh,no that's fine! I actually saw it yesterday at lunch and read it in a song dingy creepy way.  Which would have been terrifying the previous night Not only family-state, but competitiveness vs cooperation. In the west we're pushed to compete from childhood.That’s true and I’ve heard this before...  the thing that weirds me out is that I never “wake up” from the thing...  the images just start to dissolve until I’m just sitting there awake.  Maybe this is a sleep paralysis thing too but if it is I’ve never heard people talk about it before[deleted][removed][deleted][removed][removed]This probably servers a valid purpose for you. Does it calm you or help organize your thoughts or stay focused?I actually do this as well. I tend to have one sided conversations in my mind with an imaginary 'audience' where I start explaining a thing and get sidetracked frequently. Since I absorb lots and lots of random trivia, there's no shortage of topics to get sidetracked with.

I sometimes use it to practice conversations I would want to have with someone in real life, but by the time the opportunity comes up, I either forget what I wanted to talk about, or just don't, because in my mind, the conversation has already happened. It's not a very useful technique, haha.

Edit: worth noting that my 'audience' started out as talking to hypothetical telepaths when I was very young, but changed as I got older.Oh we know. *We know.*Same should I be worried?Hey, if you act as if the world works like in books, all that changes is that your life is slightly more interesting. I occasionally ask animals if they're sapient beings just on the off chance that they might react.or if youre thinking about sex and you just know they're just well practiced at not reacting to the thoughts of annoying horny men bit can totally read your gross thoughts.your average age range for men is correct, but for women it can be into the 30s.  also... *you're. (cue "ackthually" meme)

edit: I stand ackcthuhhualliedYeah, me, too. I also hear music as I'm falling asleep. It's a common enough experience that there's a name for it but I forget what it is. The less sleep I get, the more faces I start to see in patterns. Our floor tiles in the bathroom, the woodgrain on the ceiling etc.This is such a cute name for something that terrifies me every other month or so! Lol thanks for the reply!wish mine crystal ball judged me instead of just regular judgedIf you think you have schitzophrenia from reading a thread on Reddit, maybe some further reading is suggested.  Collective conciousness was one of the most relatable concepts I have ever been introduced to.  Thanks for the links!No.  No religious instruction in my home.Right. Apologies for the snark.  Thank you for your reply. :)It was one of the least troubling things as it enforced a moral code that I had to stick to.  Lucky too, because my instincts were anything but pure.  In hindsight it is probably a self regulating behavior that got way out of hand.  I've been in treatment for a few years, which is why I can work outside of the rigid thinking I have had in the past.  Thank you for your reply.I'm not a he.darn, I was going to go with post man pun. have my upvoteI couldn't agree more with what you said. Thank you for sharing your insights only_glass. I would like to share with you that I will be a freshly minted US MD this year and my medical education has been centered around humanism first and foremost. Throughout, we were taught how to gain trust from our patients, to listen A LOT and provide individualized treatment plans as schizophrenia affects all walks of life and no two cases are the same. I know that me having helped patients living with schizophrenia in no way qualifies me to say I know what its like, but the new generation of MDs will definitely be more capable to handle the complexities it entails. 
I also really like your Chinese food analogy. Spot on. As a behavior analyst, this is exactly what we do.  There are plenty of “odd” or “atypical” behaviors that people engage in for whatever reason, but as long as they don’t affect someone’s ability to live a full, rich, healthy and productive life, then what’s the harm?  There are plenty of people who need help with things that actually limit their freedom, who could use the support instead!  How could I determine if my SO has Schizophrenia? He's been diagnosed with PTSD, severe anxiety, anxiety induced seizures, severe agoraphobia, borderline paranoia.... but something just isn't.... right? I don't know. He can't stop self destructive behaviour (not physical harm). Mental health help is severely lacking in this place and I'm kind of on my own in this land-mine ridden, slippery sloped, twisted path to recovery😞. I think he has ODD but could it be schizo? You sound rational and highly educated about your illness and to have a sense of acceptance. But, what does one do when it’s the complete opposite? 
My sister has been diagnosed as bipolar schizophrenic and has continued to decline mentally for the last 8 years. (For context, I am 40, she’s 29. I have recently moved into my dad’s and have a much clearer understanding of how sick she really is. I am scared of her hurting myself or my dad during her rages. She has threatened some outrageous things and has gone so far as to try to attack my 18yr old daughter....for being prettier than her. 
She has become more and more physically violent and is provoked without reason. She is in and out of jail for her behavior. This last offense was for attacking two social workers. She refuses to take her meds unless she is incarcerated and is forced. 
When she is home, The auditory delusions are almost constant and result in her attacking my father. She says some of the most disgusting, vile things one could imagine. And sometimes, I believe that she doesn’t know who she is. She has children and during an incident was calling herself her oldest son’s name. 
It’s all so stressful and in all honesty, I may know that she is not in control of herself due to this illness. But, I can’t help but find myself hating her because of the things she says and does. 
Just looking for any insight. Sounds like through knowing yourself, you have a lot to teach/share. Thank you.As a medical student i would say you hit it extremely opposite with that view and from a medical point of view, naming the disorder is important, especially for pharmacological treatment, however i also support the view that treatment should be more symptomatic.

You see schizophrenia is generally related to disfunction in the dopamine and serotonin systems, blockers for that system are what are known as antipsychotics, anti depressants on the other hand increase stimulation of those systems(especially serotonin these days). Prescribing anti depressants to a schizophrenia patient on the basis that he is depressive could risk provoking a serious psychotic episode.

The problem with your stand point is mainly to do with pharmacological treatment, of course and so i think there should be simply more focus on symptomatic evaluation of patients within dissease categories and to be frank it often isnt done simply because of two main issues, one to do with legal issues and other with a huge issue in medicine in general.

The former is that if you don't adhere to the treatment guidelines you put your medical career in huge risk should your patient hurt himself or others. This has more to do with guidelines than with the fact there - in case of antipsychotics the doses are often higher than needed and lead to serious metabolic problems and parkinsonism, which might be avoided by decreasing dose while still reaching effect. These same guidelines dictate that acute psychosis is treated with antipsychotics, so your doctor, if perceiving your eating disorder as a psychosis, really has no choice but to push for medication.

And the latter is simply the huge patient quotas that often do not let doctors dedicate enough time to a single patient, to effectively evaluate and treat with safer, more time consuming methods, or to simply find the time to push for that treatment.

I am not saying that the psychiatrist was right to push for medication in your case, im just trying to illustrate some problems in modern medicine and show that it is not simply so black and white...Out of curiosity, how bad were things in regarda to your eating disorder that made the nurses tell you that you didnt have very long yet to live if you didnt start eating properly?

Had some problems eating aswell, I like food, I just tend to mentally block myself from making food and eat it. And often I do pass out in a controlled manner for many many hours and then wake up to realizing that I have to get food immediately cause I might otherwise fade out.

Once I carried stuff from the supermarket and got dizzy when I entered the door at home, my heart was pounsing like crazy and I ended up just fainting on the sofa.

After that Little scary event I became a bit better at managing food, but I am kinda afraid that it might secretly be lethal at some point.Thank you for your reply! I couldn't agree more. I work with people who have rare diseases, which are often accompanied by symptoms of mental illness. It is really painful to hear that often true symptoms (i.e. difficulty swallowing food, projectile vomiting, weird skin rashes) were dismissed by medical personnel due to the 'labels' that that person had. The patient is usually right (as opposed to the saying 'the patient always lies'). 

As far as I know (I'm not a psychiatrist), the idea never was to use the DSM as a handbook for diagnosis, but rather for classification of patients to enable e.g. comparisons for clinical trials. However, somehow, the entire system became distorted and now you suddenly need to fit in a specific box to get your treatment reimbursed - and worse, that 'checklist ticking' attitude to diagnosis has pervaded medical thinking as well. Instead of looking what a person describes and how it impairs daily life, impersonal criteria are used, that often do not capture the severity for the person who experiences the symptoms. Or indeed the reverse - people can be high functioning even while experiencing things that the majority of the population does not experience. 

Thanks again for sharing your perspective! In writing my other comment i forgot i also wanted to compliment you on being so intelligent and educated on your problem, not many patients put in time with their problems outside of doctors appointments!I was literally locked in a mental ward and was told I was manic depressive, bipolar and schizophrenic and would never function as a adult, never keep a job never go to college and never have a family.

When I got out I moved away from my ex girlfriend (son's mother) I went to college, I became a successful welder making over 100k and had another child with another woman.

I was gas lighted so bad and mentally abused I ended up in the hospital, all the doctors wanted to do was prescribe me pills because I had a chemical imbalance and tell me everything I believed was a delusion and nothing this woman did to me was true.

Doctors are full of shit and pill pushers for big pharma.
That woman was a massive manipulator and life destroyer.

Don't be fooled
Go mgtowyo your diagnoses are so similar to mine. 

personally I'm very attached to diagnostics because I have absolutely no identity and need them to feel like I'm real. but deep down I know you're right.

and I was the opposite of you- severe eating disorder, got to Near Death (was put in the icu for a couple days even), and no one's been working on Whats Actually Going On/whats causing me to compulsively starve myself. so it just kept getting worse and worse and the psychologists wouldn't talk to me about my issues around identity or my delusions or whatever because "this is anorexia specific therapy" and eventually I started hurting myself again. that was really bad. I was in a really bad place.

things are getting better now. I hope they are for you too!@only_glass: Wow. You put that so well and I couldn't agree more. I'm in my mid-30s and have been to psychiatrists/psychologists since I was 14. I've been diagnosed with many different things over the last 20 years - Depression (MDD), Anxiety (GAD), ADHD, Bipolar, PTSD, Borderline Personality (BPD). I was also dx with a rare, progressive, life-shortening neuromuscular disorder (with no cure) in 2006. My quality of life became even more important to me at that time. However, I still felt like psychologists were consumed with the task of placing me in a box and then treating me with xyz and not listening to my concerns. I received my BA in Psychology in 2009. While I never contended to know more than any experts, I was a bit taken aback when I was still treated like a moron (which I'm not - with or without a degree)!

Anyway, so I completely share your grievance about psychiatrists not listening to their patients needs. I love your analogy with the Chinese food. I'm also happy that you now seem to be doing great!

Edit: Added @only_glassI'm not going to give specific medical advice :). If they feel concerned in any way, it never hurts to consult a doctor. Fifty years ago, if you heard random short musical ditties or a vibration on your skin, people would think you were a bit strange. Now, if you occasionally hallucinate your cell phone ringing or vibrating when it's not, you're completely normal.In large surveys examining non institutionalized people, up to 37% reports having hallucinations (of any kind), most occurring either when falling asleep or waking up, but 25% reports having this during the day. (only <4% reports having visual or auditory hallucinations though). A hallucination could be as simple as that you think your phone is vibrating (so you take it out of your pocket) but it isn't.  You're correct! [deleted]In this case the hallucinations affect how you lead your life though, so maybe seeking a treatment would be advisable?There's no trusted person in your life you can reach out to for some help, or empathy when you're being hit hard?I also have a Neuroscience background. I absolutely agree with your post. And the delineation/correction you make is not only valid but for the purposes of Mental Health/Human Reality (as I denote relating my comment to) I would stand behind the phrase "accurate perception" of the objective world in the sense that we are able to interact with, observe and function throughout said objective world with a high degree of accuracy. I would say humanity's potential/achievements up to this temporal stage would support that we interpret and manipulate said interpretation of the world much more efficiently and abstractly than any other organism. Thank you for your insight and reply though! You definitely do make a very good point. Subjectivity **is** fundamentally inaccurate. I should have included more relative terms :).

EDIT: Have replaced "very" with "somewhat accurate" to potentially assuage some of your misgivings.I don't have schizophrenia, though I do have rapid-cycling bipolar 1 (successfully medicated for almost five* years now!). Back when I was first starting treatment, after being misdiagnosed and treated for MDD for years, I was taking lorazepam in copious amounts to deal with my mixed manic episodes. (I was later prescribed seroquel for the mixed stuff, though I've only needed it a handful of times.)

I think it was a combination of that plus insomnia that had me tripping merry balls one time, because I saw a cluster of three of these "shadow people" behind me in the mirror. I was doing my makeup at the time and it felt like they were telling me to do blue eye shadow on one side and green on the other. Not like an audible voice or anything--more like a *suggestion,* for lack of a better word. It was really similar to what my internal monologue is like when I'm shitfaced, except I could vaguely see these *things* behind me.

Then I took a nap, because lorazepam wears you out. When I woke up and saw my face, I had a good laugh. That's pretty much the only time I've experienced anything close to psychosis, though I hesitate to call it that because my reality testing was still intact (i.e. I knew that shit wasn't real, so it was more interesting than frightening, kind of like a waking dream).

Sometimes when I'm manic and/or drifting off to sleep, my brain decides it hears something like a detuned radio in a room far away. Again, I know it's just my brain fucking with me, but it's an interesting experience. 

In short, I think it's important for people to realize that schizophrenia isn't the only disorder that comes with hallucinations. I've found that knowing what's happening (basically, your brain misfiring like a beat-up car) and that it's not real makes it less scary and more like an interesting journey down the rabbit hole.

ETA: My therapist and psychiatrist are both aware of this stuff. I haven't popped a true manic episode in years so it hasn't much cause for concern. That being said, I do not miss being manic because holy shit.

** I can't math and I forgot how old I am.So they're indistinguishable but are comprised of multiple colours and have humanoid shapes? Or are they one shade, like a shadow and/or have no distinctive form? I relate to this. Thank you for this comment. It was helpful to read I'm not alone. there's no need to lie, of course people get meds forced on them. Often for their own good, but sometimes not - and in any case it does happen and anyone with the faintest grasp on reality will know that. You're invalidating the rest of what you're saying with obvious lies like that.>  I'd definitely talk to a psychologist or psychiatrist about your symptoms.

I'm so afraid to talk about my symptoms.  So I just talk around some of them.  Got me a prescription for Adderall that way.  Don't really have time to notice the symptoms anymore..seriously could they be symptoms of anything else? if I'm not to sure about this how do I seek professional diagnostic? and how do i do it for free since I'm broke :(Listen to this lasagna. It has a PhD. It's not an MD, but it is delicious.

But seriously, if it's not affecting your ability to live normally, it's not worth diagnosing.Yup. Just tell Mental Health someone on the internet told you to get it checked out. They'll push you to the top of the wait list. :PI came to this thread because it seemed like it would be interesting. I’m leaving this thread feeling blessed because i don’t feel like a camera is on me 24/7. [deleted]This! All of those things you described I CANNOT relate to. I am mentally quite average. Please go to a psychiatrist !!*Except for when, like, WAY, too highSee, I've thought that at times, but a majority of my work is for a company making surveillance equipment, which for a time was entirely focused on covert deployment and operation (now it's more mainstream stuff). When you're working with tiny cameras that are literally meant to be hidden in lamps or water bottles or whatever or microphones hidden in lightbulbs that transmit audio 3 houses down using nothing but built in power lines, it makes sense to be a *little* suspicious.

That being said, just because /u/baconbake is feeling that way doesn't necessarily mean that he/she should drop everything and "get help" now. It's something I'd mention to a doctor if it becomes a daily issue, but if it's not affecting their life in a negative way then it's not something to rush out and get treatment for. It's been said elsewhere in the thread, but a "disorder" is called that because it's something that causes suffering/lowers your overall ability to function in daily life (i.e. introduces serious disorder into normal life making it very difficult to function). 

If you have one or two symptoms of a mental disorder but you feel you have no problem living your life (as in, you're not going out of your way to work around your symptoms and they're in no way affecting your ability to have a happy life, they're just "there"), it's probably going to be *worse* for you to run out, get diagnosed with something, and get thrown onto anti-psychotics (which can have some *horrible* side effects). It would probably be a good idea to make your doctor aware of it the next time you see them (so they have that reference in case it gets worse), but just have a conversation with them and make sure to let them know that you don't feel it's affecting your life negatively at this point.

As someone who's dealt with ADHD and depression, I would have to say that *not* being on drugs and being mildly annoyed by a mental health issue that you understand and can cope with is *far better* than being put on a lot of drugs and feeling dependent on them to live your life. If you're living your life and are generally happy with it, I wouldn't worry too much.

They're always watching. I just care less these days. 

But yeah, since a kid. Way before camera phones or video recorders. They were up there filming to use against me one day. 

Or maybe that's just God? It happened twice while I was driving long distances. I was 20 I think? So that doesn’t concern me as much as other things- just thought I’d comment about it because it was not a pleasant thing to see. It doesn’t affect anything. It’s more if I’m alone and I start getting anxious. It’s not all the time that these things happen, and I’m able to push a lot of it out of my mind. It was a lot worse when I was in my teens, and I have talked to professionals. The furthest any diagnoses has gone is anxiety. 

But super fun to wake up to all this. What the fuck are you talking about?Can we get this guy flagged as a harmful idiot poster? You could be convincing someone who actually needs help not to get it with your stupid 14 year old conspiracy theories. We literally know how the brain works. We're even starting to simulate it. >Dealt with it like jetlag - stay awake as long as you can on that first day, then crash at a respectable hour so you're up and at 'em the next morning.

That's what I did when I went to England (five hour time difference and an eight hour flight). Flew out at 6:00 PM Sunday, landed 6:00 AM Monday. Stayed up until nearly midnight Monday (so 30ish hours awake total).

I've never been so tired. It was bad enough I didn't realize that I kept falling asleep: I would 'sit up' to realize I lost ten or fifteen minutes.

Thank god the Uber drivers who were taking me around were honest people.>We sleep with a noise machine and my wife says she hears phantom music in it sometimes. It bothers her a bit.

I get the same exact thing. Also, most of the time in the shower, I'd swear someone upstairs has music on, but I can never hear it once the shower's off.I'm so glad this is an actual thing! When I'm in the shower I constantly hear noises, thinking that one of my kids is crying or stomping around in the next room. At night with the fan on I always hear music playing faintly outside. Thank god it's not just me, I was worried something was wrong with my hearing! Phantom music, that is the way I'll describe it from now on.
I write the most elegant and beautifully immersive music in my mind when stuck in white noise. It starts by creeping in without my consent, then I go with it as big as I can, sometimes to the point where it makes me emotional; 
And I have no way to get it out of me and into the world. It's so rich and full, I can only remember it, I can't write it down or play the sounds.

Please make a machine that will read my mind so I can share this.Oh god I'm really prone to that when tired. Fridge hum sounds like music, neighbor's AC running sounds like people arguing, etc. Weirdest one was hearing a piano playing "How Much is That Doggie in the Window?" I put the radio on between stations once to cover up the sound of my boyfriend talking on the phone so I could get some sleep and it sounded like a satanic werewolf orgy lol. Just demented howling.

I've also heard them called auditory illusions. Thankfully I haven't let myself get that sleep-deprived in quite a while! It was terrifying. Like it's 2am and you hear what sounds like people talking somewhere in the house and you don't know what to do. Interesting, but no thanks.Same happens to me. I call it Ghost Radio.My SO and I can hear singing when we have the fan in our bedroom on. That’s a neat explanation. Thank you. This makes me wonder if noise cancelling headphones with white noise can trigger or amplify these reactions.So *that's* what that is! I usually get it strongest when there is a fan blowing over the bed. In my right ear I hear guitar shredding, and in my left ear I hear soft electronica. One side makes it easier to sleep...Perhaps you may know something about what I experience when tripping then. So, during the end of an acid trip. When I'm tucking into bed. The acid has all worn off pretty much. Just a little restless. The thing that bothers me most at this point, is the white noise I hear. I'll go through an entire trip just fine. Once the silence of trying to sleep hits. All I can here is sirens, white noise, and other kind of terrible repetitive sounds and I'm not sure why this happens. It doesn't stop me from tripping, and now when I do it I take a xanax at bed time to shut off. But, what am I actually hearing at that point if I did try to sleep without the xanax. Ambient noise coupled with distortions from the acid even though If I were to just open my eyes the sounds would be gone?? Mkay, that would bother me quite a bit as well as its creepy as hell. Music always means something gonna happen according to the movies.> I used to play those games all of the time when I was a kid. But something about that damn frequency got engraved in my psyche.

Audio Engineer here. It's very likely that you are remembering hearing higher frequencies than you can hear today. When we are kids, our hearing extends way up beyond 20kHz, but as babies we learn that adults don't make those high pitched noises, so we sort of forget to be able to hear them. As a kid, you'd be able to hear frequencies coming out of the gameboy you'd likely have lost by your mid/late 20s.Yup when reading this thread I was thinking about how I could always hear the Pokémon theme in my head for hours after playing my game boy as a kid. that theme specifically, no other game ever did that.Last time i ate shrooms I could hear the Pokemon music in white noise. Sometimes if I try really hard I still can too. The brain's a strange little sponge isn't it.Pokemon being placed on portray for healibg at pokecenter. Brtz brtz brtz brtz brtz brtz, dum dum dunna dum!This happens to me when I'm not high. Cat meowing, low talking in the next room, laughing, music. White noise isn't always involved but it's always while there's some sound. When it's absolutely quiet I never hear anything. Both sides of my family have some history of schizophrenia, but I just turned 30 this year and none of these things have ever progressed beyond ambient sounds so I think I'm in the clear. They do kick into extremely high gear when I smoke though.Yeah, right?

I think it's because these melodies tend to have such odd switches between tones (to catch people's attention). Whenever you happen to hear any one of those switches in isolation, and given enough white noise, your brain will just fill in the rest![deleted]I'm a female, but thank you, anyway. :-)Glad to have found ypu guys...i spent the last year worried i lost my grip on reality and all the anxiety had actually begun to drive me insaneThe science is constantly improving by some healthcare providers don't catch up quickly :( do you mind if I ask what your diagnoses are now?Like, I would hear a person cough or laugh or mutter something (in real life), and it would echo over and over in my head, becoming more grotesquely distorted each time until it sounded like a demon was saying it. Other times, I would hear a voice mumbling indistinctly: I could tell what the speajer was like (an angry boss lady, a tired old man) but not what they were saying. Oh it gave me my worst ever anxiety attack for no reason; everyone else opened their eyes all relaxed while I had to be given a sedative lmao. I was later advised that people with psychotic symptoms are supposed to stick to like guided visualisations because this isn't all that uncommon, apparently.My question was downvoted a couple times, so I'm worried I came across wrong. I didn't mean to be insensitive or say "ANTIANXIETY AND ANTIDEPRESSANT PILLS ARE BAD OKAY?!" That is the opposite of what I meant. I take an antianxiety med. I was asking because I experienced mild hallucinations, auditory and visual, when I first started taking it and each time I've changed the dose, and I've always written it off as a side effect. Thanks for answering. I’m sorry you also have to deal with that. However, it’s nice to know that it may just be a symptom of the combination rather than schizo related. >Omg I can't believe it's not normal to hear and see things that aren't there!  
  
>I am so shocked!  
  
>I must be especially special!  
  
>Pay attention to me  
  
Everybody in this thread.I will be speaking to my Doctor on Friday. 

I’m doing it this day in case I am put under observation I won’t miss work next week.Yeah, there are shadow people living among us, that's the more likely scenario.I've heard a lot of horror stories about people losing control of their own lives because of admitting depression or other mental illnesses to their doctor, how do i avoid getting drugged up and placed in a loonybin?Yup, she never aged. It's how he realized he wasn't entirely sane.Do you talk to him about things besides other people? Like... Music, comic books, etc

Is he always there? Or does he show up randomly? Or can you summon him at will?

Does he have a very defined physical appearance? Or is it vague and change from time to time?

Has he grown up over the years? Has his voice changed? Or did he remain a child?Exploding head syndrome?

Doesn't seem to be all that uncommon among people, and I experience it sometimes too.it's a reference to the NZ drunk driving commercial "Legend (ghost chips)".

all the bestAwww... Are you as emotionally attached to him as I probably would be? (A lot)

Are you sure he's not a real person, albeit the best person ever that is always around for you?[removed]In real life Nash remained active in the field until his death in a car crash two years ago. The film misrepresented the extent of his schizophrenia.

Editing to be precise: At some point in the few years running up to the publication of Cédric Villani's "Birth of a Theorem" (2016), Nash was active in the field. If he did retire prior to the car crash, it can't have been too long beforehand.You just made me remember the scene where his wife follows him to the drop point and discovers page after page of his codes. Her reaction as she puts it all together is heartbreaking."It's a Beautiful Mind", right up there with "The Stars Wars".But everything you mentioned was fictionalized. In real life he conceived of himself as a religious figure of great but secret importance, the "left foot of God on earth". At another point he considered himself to be a Go board on which the white pieces represented Confucians and the black pieces represented Muslims. The "first-order" game was being played by his two sons, while the "second-order" game was an ideological struggle between Nash personally and the Jews collectively.

In the movie that became "he had imaginary friends", which may be good cinema but is, in Nash's case, totally fictional.> It wasn't until the second half of the movie it's revealed he's schizophrenic and he's just imagined all these things.

Well, to be fair is well known that Nash is schizophrenic and I think it’s said in the movie’s synopsis too. But I get what you’re saying, they really make some things that seems normal initially and them reveal later that it’s only a product of his mind (like his roomate).Oh so like Fight ClubNo offense Meant, but Everytime someone tells me “oh you’ve Got to see that! It’s so positive and he comes out ok in the end” I want to punch them in the face! (I’m not a violent or physical person even in self defense, Huge difference (which I Never confuse) between a fleeting thought and something I’m not psychologically capable of).  Nash was left a hollow shell of his former self. Just functional, did not have many mathematical breakthroughs afterward. And was treated by Everyone with kid gloves, constantly needing (same as me) a reality check as to whom was present and what they said. There’s NO recovery. Just coping. For an accurate portrayal? I’d Personally recommend Donnie Darko or John Dies at the End. Maybe, maybe Naked Lunch?The more heartwarming version is "Lars and the Real Girl" where the guy gradually comes out of his delusion that his doll is real with the help of his community.The guy this movie was based on was actually a real person with schizophrenia. The CIA shootout crap was all highly dramatized and, for the most part, false.Wait, didn’t the cia really use him the first time to break codes? That’s why the agent that he sees later was kinda just watching at that point. As someone who had that movie spoiled before I watched it, putting the word spoiler next to it in this context is its own spoiler. Thanks for reminding me about that movie.
I found it on Netflix. I'm watching it tonight.Love that film so clever and made me see this Diagnosis in a fiffeeent light I think it's just "A Beautiful Mind"  iircIt was an amazing transition.  Discovering that shack sticks out in my mind.

I love how the title tricks you as well, at first you think it is because he is a genius but then... It's just called *A Beautiful Mind*, but in any case, I was thinking the same thing. God, that movie is good. Oooo also Shutter Island!! It's funny because when I watched that movie I figured out what was happening early on because the main character never went out drinking with his roommate. I mean seriously, who *never* goes drinking with their college roommate who they otherwise seem to get along with?I'm so confused. Was he ever really a genius? [removed]Shutter IslandShutter islandYou mean Shutter Island?  They replay that on the SyFy channel all the time.Titanic Island of Wallstreet, and the WolfThe beach? The one with the water?Is that what happened in that movie? What’s Eating Gilbert GrapePoison Ivy There was enough room on that Island for Jack to have survived DANG IT!! The Beach.I think you are talking about the third movie in the Inception trilogy¿The beach?The BeachI think he meant Tom Hanks in Cast AwayIs that The Beach or The Cove.

The other is abouts dolphins' laughter. Shutter Island, better as a book. 10/10 would recommend reading even if you know the twist.Shutter IslandThe beach island “The Beach”Shitty Island Thx for movie advice! Nothing beats word of mouth.River was...... beyond words. I enjoyed it thoroughly. I Love to Love will never be the same againYou might like the TV show 'legion'.Yeah, the whole "he's actually schizophrenic" thing is almost like "it was all a dream" at this point. A little overused. There was a character like that in a Tamora Pierce fantasy novel - he had the one-in-a-generation magical gift of hearing sounds and seeing images on the wind, talked about what he saw, and had to live in "madhouses" for a long time.As a schizophrenic, that is how it feels...Me, too!  Very realistic portrayal of mental illness.  Its a good watch.  Knowing the whole plot kinda kills it, but still worthyYep. Also (originally thought it was just me, but) thought projection, where you’re Certain Everyone around can hear what you’re Really thinking, know what kind of person you Really are. And you hear them talking to each other (or thinking) about all your worst aspects, most terrible thoughts. And purposely speak to each other about you (even if it’s in code) so you can hear them doing it. As I said, if it's handled correctly and not done insensitively.It's tough but I'm still young so I guess it builds character.

Your kind thoughts are appreciated :)What I meant was imagine someone intuitive AND they get hallucinations that reflect that intuition. Subjectively, that might feel quite a lot like mind reading.Yeah but looking back I shake my head thinking what the hell was I doing. You see I didn’t know how to type on a keyboard back then. Iv done this several times. As well as with dreams. But I’m eventually able to realize it’s from a dream or just a fake conversation I had with someone in my head. I feel like realizing they aren’t real is the big deal. Bipolar/Schizophrenia runs in my family, lots of suicides, and it’s something I worry about.They are. As someone else posted somewhere else in this thread, schizophrenia  causes issues with  the ability to detect that "something" that doesn't  make sense.Hypnagogic episode.  Very very normal.I’m not alone! I️ would always ask people if this has happened to them and they’d respond with that stupid “you should get that checked haha!”

It happened frequently when my kids were babies and toddlers. I was always exhausted back then to begin with and I always thought I heard them calling daddy or just crying from their room. It sucked because I would be so ready to sleep and so close to being out like a light but nope now I gotta get up and check if my kids really need me or if I'm hallucinating again.  I’ve had plenty of this, but it’s always been a “normal” aspect of the sleep paralysis I’ve been dealing with all of my life.  I get that sometimes too, usually as I'm drifting off to sleep. The weirdest was when I was prescribed some solpadol (I think? Crazy muscle relaxers anyway) to help me sleep when I had really bad flu a few years back. Id slept maybe 5-6 hours in 4 days and was starting to lose it. I popped a couple of the solpadol and soon after I started to hear weird pops and bangs around the room. At first I thought it was an electrical socket sparking out but it was moving around the room. Reaaally weirded me out. And then I realised it was probably a combination of sleep deprivation and crazy painkillers and was just an auditory hallucination. Still really weird. Slept like a baby that night though. Might be somewhat related, but when I smoked pot I would sometimes hear ambient noise (like refrigerator pumps) form into intense music. It must have been the same kind of thing that inspired rock and roll musicians (among others).Thought that was just me! I never hear Real songs. I’m not even particularly musically talented but my brain “writes songs that voices never share” if you’ll pardon a quote. One of Very few pleasant artifaces. Sometimes I’ll stay in bed motionless just to hear Amazing tunes I know will disappear and I’ll never hear again. 
Sidebar: saw an Awesome movie in a dream/hypnopompic hallucination. Wish I could watch that again... “gone, like tears in the rain...”That happens to me too! It is very fleeting. If I realize it's in my head it disappearsI once took 2 tabs of lsd, and during my peak of it my friend was like "Drink all the water" to me. After hearing that, I heard like 2 or 3 voices that kept chanting "Drink all the water" to me. It sounded so surreal. The voices sounded like it was coming from all around me. I knew it was the lsd that was making me hear the auditory hallucinations, but when I went to the bathroom and was there alone, I was amazed at how real the voices sounded. It was my first time having auditory hallucinations.I'd be interested in hearing others' experiences with these. Until now, I've only heard of others rarely encountering them, which has always concerned me since I typically encounter them once or twice nightly. Every night for years right when I fall asleep, I see myself, my bed, and/or my room covered in spiders, causing me to jump out of bed and repeatedly brush myself off with my hands until I realize it was a hallucination. It's really bothersome, but I have gotten about as used to it as you might imagine. My doctor doesn't seem too worried, though, so I guess I'm fine.So I️ get people talking in my head a lot. None of what they say makes any sense (jumbled bits of short phrases), but I️ believe it’s all things that have been said to me at one point in time. Sort of like someone taking a tape recorder of every interaction I’ve ever had and cutting it all up then gluing it back together in a random order. Would this be considered the same thing?as a musician i'm honestly kinda jealousOh thank God. Was about to freak out. Yeah I get that sometimes too. I think I hear my doorbell ring or someone loudly banging on my door and I jump up out of bed but that less often than the random voice I hear right before I fall asleep.I wasn't saying I know what it's like to be schizophrenic. His comment was a response to a question asking if the voices sound audible or something along those lines. My my comment was a response to his answer. I said "I think I know what you mean". As in how the voices might sound. I would never claim to know what it's like to be schizophrenic just because I occasionally hear a voice right before I fall asleep. That's rediculous.A couple of times in my life I heard just random sentences or phrases. One was "there is one thing that you must and will understand..." and that was it. I was sitting on the toilet thinking, "Well WHAT IS IT?!" LOL.... guess I was 14. 

And of course, occasionally my mother's voice just says my name, sharply. Often I'm half asleep. I don't think it's schizophrenia, though. It's only happened a few times over the course of my 52 years.making an assumption here (maybe a big one) that you are a Christian/believe in the Christian God as you mentioned you have a bible (correct me if I'm wrong)

how does schizophrenia affect your faith and/or vice versa?That's terrifying. I'm sorry you had that happen to you :/ you're right though. If it happens enough you question realityNot to diminish At All, but why after I was convinced (with Needed pharmaceutical aid) I’d “lost it” turned my arms over to my out of state folks with the only condition they never got rid of them. Do I think I’m capable of some horror? Not at ALL willing to bet a life on it? Even More NOGlad to hear you're doing better! That combined with mood swings would not be fun.I didn't see any reason to question it.That's pretty fascinating, thank you for sharing.Do you think your past comes into place regarding the gender of the voice? Any dominant males from your past?That's interesting. I don't wanna say I envy you because I'm sure it's been a struggle, and I don't mean to offend. But in a morbid curiosity way I do wish I could have just a taste of what it's like. It's the same thing as when I get told blind people don't see black, they see nothing. Like what does that mean.[removed]I'm sorry, did you miss the reference?[removed]Yeah, it's hard to generalize from personal experience. The folks I know are american and grew up religious and that seems to have been a pretty good recipe for not a great childhood.> Most parents would just think their kid was being silly or trying to get attention.

Or people who would talk about what their parents did do so because they're not happy with them, leading you to believe that the shitty 20% of parents are actually 80% of parents.

I'd like to thank Vilfredo Pareto for the numbers I basically pulled out of my rectum.uh... different cultures where people expect different things I guessI hate that argument, that you don't have this because those people don't know that they have it.  Like clearly they have done little research into the matter and are just shouting assumptions.

I'm really sorry to hear you've gone through all that, but I would recommend you keep trying to find a counsellor that you gel with.  I was lucky and found an amazing one second try, but my friends and my doctor told me it is important to keep looking until you find the right match. 
Good Counsellors are literal life Savers. Were you on amphetamines for the ADHD when the schizophrenia started? Curious because I get really bad psychosis from amphetamines.I️ could definitely see schizophrenic symptoms being misdiagnosed as ADD/HD.

In fact almost any disorder could be misdiagnosed as ADHD seeing as being generically “distracted” would just come with the territory....Are you worried about a shift? Is there a point where that worry is reduced?This x1000. Especially since the OP seems to have had a relatively easy course, I wonder if it was medication-induced to begin with. Psychosis is not such an uncommon side effect of Ritalin et al, actually. Typically it goes away once the medication is stopped. Yes.

It's active on dopaminergic pathways (agonist)

Schizophrenia is caused by abnormal dopaminergic pathways in brain and many can live normal lives with dopamine receptor antagonists... Such as Thorazine. 

But this leads to Parkinson's disease manifestations where a lack of dopamine transport is the cause of the shaking.

Parkinson's disease is treated with L-DOPA, which can cause schizophrenic manifestations where an excess of dopamine transport is the cause of the increased stimulus - sensory overload type of thing.

Or that's how I understand it.

Look up LEVA DOPA SCHIZOPHRENIA PARKINSONIAN MOVEMENT
Or something.

Look it up, you will learn so much about how things work within our bodies & brainsKind of what I thought. Thanks for an answer. I think it may be because both disorders impair executive function.Yeah I feel like a lot of diagnoses kinda dogpile. Like I'm bipolar and have an anxiety disorder and am borderline and it's like all my issues just flow together A professor of mine said that you cannot have one without the other. I don't like to generalize an entire population of people/two entirely different disorders. But I have never seen anyone who had anxiety without depression or vice versa. And I know from personal experience that my anxiety actually causes my depression. So the two often go hand in hand.[deleted]The DSM is a guide, and it's very helpful. But the information inside it is not guaranteed to be inside the doctors, PAs and NPs that are licensed to prescribe medications to treat these disorders. 


I have had to reverse the orders of many a psychiatrist in my practice because they didn't know what they were doing. 


I hope the docs did everything right for 
u/meteoritesalad. I really do and likely they did based on his comments. But if there is a chance that there was a misdiagnosis because of a missed side effect wouldn't you want to know? Isn't it a question worth asking? [removed]Inner monologue. You would think it would be more common knowledge. Here is something scary. My aunt is a devout fundamentalist Christian and believed her inner monologue used for thinking and reading is the Holy Spirit. She casually tossed this out in conversation. My uncle who is also fundamentalist is like, wait what? And our whole family piles on that those are her own thoughts and words. She became much less religious after that. All those years she thought her inner narration was a direct conversation with God. To her now, he is very far away and tangential. Basically this, thank you for the cool wiki artical too!My inner monologue has a speech impediment, sometimes.When I started watching craig ferguson on TV, everything I went to do was narrated by his voice, in my head, for a week straight.

It started out hilarious, then got boring, then got wierd. Thankfully, went away. Goodbye, handsome scottish man-voice in my brain.Yeah I honestly don't understand how you couldnt have one unless they'd never heard anything before.Some people's internal dialog is in words. Others don't have that. The ideas are there without being packaged into words. It's extremely common and normal to hear your names or sounds when falling asleep or waking up.  I often hear a loud clap.  My dad hears a metallic crash.  Very normal :)A dead person? Lol /sYeah that sums it up well.Look at the stats. They don't really hurt anybody at a higher rate than the normal population. But when they do they go about it in a weird way so people remember it.your explanation of word salad, I wonder if there's consensus with other people with schizophrenia?  if so, it's info that should be more widely sharedYup. I'm on seroquel and lamictal and they've both been godsends. I got lucky, though, and my psych got the right combo of meds for me on the very first try. I remember from when I was a kid, doctors trying to find the right ADHD and depression meds for me and nothing panning out, so I'm pretty happy about this. Ah, I should've mentioned that haha. I'll add it to my comment, because you're exactly right, medication totally depends on the person. I'm really glad to hear it works for you! My dad also had really good luck eith it but something about me just doesn't click with it I guess. But it's good that you found the right combination for you! I feel like very few things should matter more to someone than their mental health. [deleted]I was on I believe 250mg when I stopped taking it. After I reached a certain dosage the sleepiness kind of just plateaued, like u/HumanDrinkingTea mentioned. It was still ridiculous and unreasonable, though. I was finishing high school at the time and couldn't stay awake in class. I'd fall asleep in class and continue to have those weird dreams. Doctor said "it's normal, you'll settle into your new dose and be fine" so I waited longer than I probably should've for it to get better, but it never did.God that's horrible, I'm so sorry :(  my doctor had warned me seroquel would make me tired and suggested I take it on a Friday night so I had the weekend to adjust to how tired it would make me. I took it before bed that night and slept until the next afternoon. The same thing happened for the next two weeks. I had to set several alarms and have my mom wake me up for school as well, and even then it would take me hours to wake up and never fully woke up after all of that anyway. 

The numbness and the counting were what finally made me realize it wasn't helping. Instead of helping smooth things over like my doctor had told me it would, it flatlined my brain and all of my emotions. It took me from one extreme to the other. The withdrawal was god-awful, I wouldn't wish that on anyone. I was nauseous to the point of being unable to eat anything, lost a few pounds because of that, had nightmares instead of just weird dreams, constant headaches, and my moods were uncontrollable. I was off the handle and crying constantly. It was terrible.My understanding is it will either save you or ruin you. I happened to get the shitty end of the deal, and it sounds like you did too. It's a fucked up thing but, like you said, glad we made it through. I hope you're doing well. :)People say, "Well, you won't be yourself if you take medication."

Fuck. That. Medication helps me be who I really am. 

The real me doesn't sleep for 18 hours, neglect family and friends, lose jobs, and have panic attacks in public. That's the depression and anxiety. That's not me. As someone with ADHD I find it surprising that it could be mistaken for bipolar.  I can think of some overlapping characteristics but on the whole very different disorders... I think he's just trying to convey that it is a serious matter that she isnt on meds. and she should keep trying.How about with just, we want OP to be comfortable and happy. And while the cure may be problematic in itself, I imagine any comfort and happiness can poof away in the blink of an eye when OP ends up doing something drastic due to their condition.

I hate taking my anti depressant I really do. On top of that, it costs me 150 bucks a month. But hey, I'm not driving my car right off the boardwalk and into the water because I feel suicidal which is how I felt for a year prior to taking it. Imagine the grief, the work I would cause everyone around me including the sad saps who have to dig my car out of the ocean. Point is, conditions make people do drastic shit, meds suck but the alternative sucks much harderI merge without looking and without using turn signals. Police and driving instructors tell me I shouldn't, but I like the freedom of just swerving around on the highway.

Don't try to tell me I might hurt someone, you don't know that for sure.Agreed there's nothing that says that you'll necessarily hurt anyone (more likely self harm imo). Sometimes we (people with mental illness) just do/believe weird stuff you might have just a teensy bit of confirmation bias on this one>I'm unmedicated and every psychiatry and behavioral specialist wants me on meds. They say I'm like a small brush fire and it only gets worse with age.

I can't believe you fucking enabling morons are defending this shit right now.Schizophrenia can make you have hallucinations that lead you to believe your life is in danger and thus you could be violent to defend yourself... Except the danger isn't real

The problem is not that schizophrenia makes you a bad person, is that it may lead you to believe you're in a situation where anyone else react with violence Schizophrenics are at a high risk of hurting themselves or others. They do have a high potential to be abused. Those arent mutually exclusive.If all your doctors want you on meds and describe you as a brush fire, they clearly think you'll hurt yourself or someone else. Psychologists are taught not to prescribe medication unless the patient's illness is interfering with their quality of life, or if they are a danger to others. They are 100% right that schizophrenia only gets worse with age-- studies confirm this. You need to keep trying different medications. Actually you just stated that you have schizoaffective/bipolar disorder. So yeah...you are the crazy one here. > Not every person with a mental illness will hurt someone

That's true. Some people get treated for it and take their meds.You're misunderstanding where the danger comes from. It's not that it would make you a bad person, or want to to hurt someone.

Is that, just like sometimes you reach for something, you react to your hallucination. And this may lad you to believe things that would make anyone react with violence : you may believe your life is in danger, you may believe a loved one's life is in danger or any other similar thing

And as your condition worsens so does you ability to self diagnose and decide whether or not you fine enough. https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/14/opinion/sunday/should-we-all-take-a-bit-of-lithium.html[deleted]This. I have an older brother with paranoid schizophrenia, and as much as I appreciate the effort, I often wonder if that movie hurt more than it helped the public perception of schizophrenia. Also had to watch it in AP Psych in high school with my class. Listening to my classmates' mislead questions about the disease and then my teacher reaffirming their views was painful.That's interesting to me, because a lot of what people are saying in this thread reminds me of hallucinatory sleep paralysis. I get really intense hypnagogic hallucinations, which are most commonly auditory and tactile, but also regularly visual.

With both schizophrenia and HSP, some get only auditory hallucinations, while others get both. Like HSP, some have said that, when they see a figure in the room, it's somehow "menacing." The "babbling" some schizophrenics hear sounds a lot like one of the less common auditory hallucinations I have.

The irrational fear (as if you're in a nightmare) with HSP doesn't seem to have a direct corollary, nor does the paranoia of schizophrenia have a corollary with HSP. So, clearly there are differences... beyond the obvious difference of "one happens all the time and the other happens when you're paralyzed in bed just before falling asleep or just after waking up."

But I could totally buy the idea that schizophrenia is essentially an active dream-state when you're fully conscious.do you have any info that would lead me to some of that research? Or an article on the research? really interested.Wow - I commented elsewhere in this thread about when I stupidly tried to break the on-campus stay awake record.

As I edged closer to 100 hours I started losing grip on reality, and I started having auditory and visual hallulicinations.  It felt like I was dreaming, but awake as well - not a lucid dream, though.  In a lucid dream I think "this is a dream, with a little consciousness," rather I felt "this is reality, with a little dream."[deleted]Jesus I'm glad I don't have anything like that. I'd probably have gone super insane worrying about people trying to get me.Whelp, first night living alone after 2 years with someone... tonight is gonna be a “leave all the lights on” kind of night. Hope you’ve got a handle on those hallucinations. Sounds scary.>Then I remembered that friend lived in a different state.

That's the part that brought you comfort? Because that would be the part that made me flip out. Sounds like this could also be sleep paralysis if they only occur when you're about to fall asleep.So these happen while you are awake? That sounds similar to sleep paralysis, which I hear can be intense. I also have visual hallucinations in the dark, usually upon first opening my eyes after dozing off. Its not people though. Its always a glowy thing floating in the air, right in front of my face, or a few feet away.

Might be a glowy spider, dragon, or a rose. It will be floating and slowly turning, or slowly waving its legs or whatever. It fades out after just a few seconds of looking at it.

I’ve always figured its because my eyes have opened before my mind has completely left dreamland, and so my brain is trying to make something out of maybe the floaters in my eyes or something.

I kind of envy you for seeing people. That seems like it would be kinda fun.Does that make it kind of weird the next time you see that person?I think id have jumped out of my skin when I remembered the guy lives across the country![deleted]That's the first thing I thought of too.  That shit hasn't happened to me in awhile but it's terrifying.  Every time there's a sleep paralysis story I see stories like this.  I've had it about 50 times in my life... each and every time I was just bored and wanted to get the hell up and read or something, but I couldn't do anything.  It's always boring and annoying.

The first 20 times it happened from shift work... the last 20 times it happened from melatonin... I cut the doses down to 500 mg and it went away.Maybe it's better to not know😂I don't get it, wouldn't you realzie right away it was fake?  Or do they move around and talk to you, like a real person?Thanks for sharing. I am very interested in all of this. Every schizophrenic seems to experience things differently and I just really want to understand it all.Lol, drugs.Nope, never was into drugs. He literally just changed over the course of a few months it seems.Schizophrenia typically appears around mid to late teens into early twenties. It's something I worried about for a lot of years since it runs in families. 

*appears= rears it's ugly head in full forceIt is bad when families think they can help but it is something that really needs a doctor.

Neurological issues tend to run in my famiy and while I am not schizophrenic (but have symptoms like it) I really do think my brother is and should be in a hospital or jail (lots of felonies and they keep letting him out) before he hurts someone.  

Unfortunately my mother keeps letting him stay with her and he makes life hell for her.Holy shit that's terrible. I have family experience with bad times on mental health wards but never anything so deliberately malicious this is awful. I'm so sorry for your cousin and I hope she can find the right meds and keep taking them to lead some kind of life.Even so, drugs have the possibility of manifesting psychological disorders the user never knew they had.Usually drugs don't "cause" someone to go schizophrenic, etc., but they will help bring these mental "situations" to surface. Essentially drugs can be a catalyst for a person to discover their own mental health issues (compared to naturally discovering it a little bit later in life if they had never done said certain drugs). 

So while it makes sense to point to drugs, especially because it's one of the easier ways for people to relate to or make sense of terrifying hallucinations. It's completely possible and likely that someone with schizophrenia will "hit a brick wall" or the increasingly negative symptoms will eventually start to interfere with the person's life, without any use of drugs. [removed]you watch too many moviesI have no idea how you got downvoted. Many shamans are better psychologists than psychologists For more background: http://www.jaysongaddis.com/the-shamanic-view-of-mental-illness/jesus fucking christ manFuck offThank you. I wish people had told me this when I was growing up.This is a very important point. Thank you. I heard somewhere: that would be like saying you can't be happy when something good happens because there's always someone who has it better.I work in retail so "worse" is always debatable.We all only have our own perspective to know, and the human mind is adaptive. Whatever environment you're in will start to feel normal too you, and we evolved to always be on edge hunting for food or safety or on the look out for predators. It's kind've an inevitable product of the human mind that everyone feels the main things that they deal with, whatever they are, are incredibly important often life or death issues.Eh.That's fascinating. I had no idea there were places like that specifically set up for long stays related to mental health. How was the person you spoke to? Did he or she talk at all about how they felt about staying there and whether they recognized that they needed that level of supervision?Is this a place in Texas? If so, my parents are the owners. It’s a 65-bed home but they have a little less right now.

Most of the clients are too high-functioning for the state hospitals but not able to be in the smaller 6-bed homes. oof, I'm so sorry. this fucked me up.

we need better healthcare in this country. and we especially need people to take mental health seriously.Jesus christ I am so sorry. This is the reality. Most institutions were done away with in the name of mainstreaming the mentally ill I to communities via a concept called community care or some similar variation. It has not worked well for the segment of our mentally ill population who simply cannot function without supervision and educated care. The number of mentally ill individuals who wind up in our jails is incredibly high. This place has a teen inpatient program and it saved my friend's life, give them a call if you can http://www.fourwindshospital.com/You’re a wonderful parent and I’m so sorry the system is failing you and your child.Please move to Canada.Exactly, I wasn’t looking for pity because my parents always try to guilt trip me with stuff such as “at least you didn’t loose both of your legs” whenever I have difficulty.Nothing like mixing chemicals with sleep deprivation when you want a little taste of what mental illness feels like! Next thing you know your grandmother's waking you up at 3:00 AM to tell you to stop taking Adderall, and you're all like 'How'd you get in to my dorm? Didn't you die 5 years ago?'I tried several SSRI's with no great results. I can't say what will work for you, but next time you're with your psych, try asking about an SSNRI. I'm taking effexor (venlafaxine), and that has helped a lot. It gives me weird dreams and it's the med that has increased the songs in my head, but the added effect of working on neopenephrine as well as serotonin has helped with motivation and mood, which makes just about everything easier to deal with. It's still not perfect, but I feel better than I have in quite a long while on that med. Me and sleep have a tumultuous relationship as well.  Given the choice I️ would also probably stay up until 4-6am and and sleep well into the afternoon. That’s just how my internal clock is and has been since I can remember. It’s not possible for me to keep that kind schedule though since I️ have a 9-5 and most nights I’ll take around 6 benadryls just to force myself to go sleep (I know this isn’t good for me).  [deleted]I've been to several psychologists and psychiatrists. They seem to want to treat the anxiety and depression and nothing else. I don't know if I'm not getting my point across about the severity, or if perhaps my symptoms aren't as severe as I think. I always defer to them since they're the professional. 

I'm not worried about how they'll react, I always try to be brutally honest since they're there to help. But like I said, I wonder if my symptoms are just not as pronounced and fall into the spectrum that most people have as well. lol sometimes when I'm mad I'll walk away from what I"m doing, be silent for a few seconds and then hit myself on the head, open palm, small wind up, always three times.

I'm sure a lot of people do little acts of masochism but mine is particular in that it always has that same rhythm: the silence, then the three hits always at the same tempo. That’s fantastic to hear.  I wish you the best of luck.I was prescribed to 2mg twice a day. A standing prescription. The few times I came off were due to the fact I couldn’t afford it. And then in jail.

I withdrew for about 3-4 months[removed]Which could be proven with documentation, as I suggested.Yes... I thought that I already addressed that in the third sentence of my previous comment...

Such a restraining order would order the person to stay away from *those people*, not *an imaginary girl*. Do you get what I'm saying?It's kinda fascinating too. Love them. Saw them live! I also have a minor case of this. Not trying to be funny but that would scare the crap out of me. The same thing happens to me when I am just falling asleep or waking up, they are called auditory hallucinations and are fairly common. It’s like when your brain is half asleep and half awake and you’re still sort of dreaming. Similar to sleep paralysis, but not related to schizophrenia. 

Edit: wordsDo you think it could be slight sleep paralysis?I have this thing you’re talking about right after waking up and I think I know what you mean about the dreams. If it makes you feel better I have been in and out of intensive psych care a couple times and I’ve never been diagnosed with schizophrenia. This is fairly common in that phase when you’re waking up, especially if you have OCD or other anxiety disorders. I wouldn’t worry until you start hearing things in your waking life.Yeah I used to have this as a teenager a lot, usually my dad yelling my name very suddenly as if to wake me up but he sounded pissed. Or sometimes it would be my door slamming. I haven’t had it in years though. Hearing someone saying your name when you're in that almost asleep state is pretty common and not necessarily indicative of mental illness. If that's your only symptom, I wouldn't worry too much about it. It is freaky though. It happens to me occasionally too.I’ve experienced

“Wake up.”

“NO.”

(Soft laughing)

And my name said a few times. Don’t fret, it could be anything from sleep paralysis, to stress, to vivid dreams.

(But while you’re at it, check out ‘Exploding Head Syndrome’.)Sounds like hypnopompic hallucinations. They're not uncommon and aren't necessarily a sign of mental illness. But if they continue to get worse or occur at other times, it would probably good to go see someoneIt can't hurt to get yourself checked out. Either way, whether it's a brief auditory hallucination from still half-dreaming or early schizophrenia, it's your mind speaking to itself. So while a diagnosis (or not!) might be scary, it's still just you talking to yourself. Best to get things checked earlier than later. My name being called happens to me once every few months and has been for as long as I can remember, the voice is very feint and rare, and its always been just my name so I seriously doubt it will ever lead to anything. You sound like you might be developing something though.Look up hypnagogic hallucinations. I get the same thing every now and then both at night and in the day. Can be a symptom of other disorders but is fairly common for most people to have experienced this at some point. We're all on the same team here and I don't wanna argue, but I do want to point out that there can be harm in it as any medical diagnoses carries the risk of a false positive. This can be devastating when the false diagnosis is one for which medium to long term periods of experimentation with different medications, often with serious side affects, is normal, i.e. a lot of mental illnesses.Well I get where you are coming from but I have had experience of auditory hallucinations both where I was aware that it was a hallucination and also where I wasn't aware at the time (but now see that they were hallucinations).

The simple explanation is that when hallucinations are experienced as part of a psychotic experience, they are often accompanied by other symptoms that distort your logic or hamper your ability to reason. Therefore even though externally, it may be completely implausible if not contradictory, at the time, it does feel consistent.

The other issue is that if there is any element of persistence in hallucinations - this can, for want of a better way of putting it, drive you mad in and of itself. The thing about hearing voices is that whether it is the result of an actual person speaking or whether it is 'all in the mind' the brain is doing the same thing - it is quite different from consciouslly imagining or remembering a voice, it is really indistinguishable from the experience of being present when someone is producing the voice so you can't underestimate the element of confusion this can create. I was going to the doctor because the pain was unbearable, the worst was probably walking, every step felt like a needle poking deep inside my ear.

It took 2 hours after I woke up for that thing to get out..Me too. I always figured it's just because most movies and TV shows are male-centric, so my brain is like 'well the star of this dream is obviously a male, and it's my dream, sooo...'
Same here.Yeah, I've never been concerned about my dreams. Its just random neurons firing in the brain, clearing out the previous day's gunk. I don't put any stock into them at all; I've also been a vampire before in a dream. I don't think that means anything either. Interesting I hadn't heard that. Thank you![removed][removed]i was someone who made a comment like, "I wonder if anyone's hallucinations are ever really nice to them, like 'hey, you look sharp in that suit' or something"

May have been a joke, which is possibly why it got removed or deleted, but also may have been serious.  I could also totally see it being a legitimate questionThankyou.Yeah, I’d always rather be sober and happy than intoxicated and feel like shit. You made the right choice. That's so crazy.  So are you constantly doing something, like how do you deal with that?Um, sometimes i know theyre real. If theyre fantastical and vanish before my eyes i realize it. But people walking around or walking behind me and saying something i can't really tell. The hallucinations arnt so bad anymore since i start anti psychotics again. I knew that van monster wasnt real but it still scared the ever living shit out of me. It was terrifying. My symptoms arnt gone theyre just dulled pretty much but on occasion i get strong breakthrough symptoms even if im on apsinteresting. thanks.No problem. Thanks for being open minded. Have you seen the video of the guy with schizophrenia that made it to the front of r/videos a couple weeks ago? In it the guy was sitting in the couch and said that he heard knocking in the door and despite knowing it was probably all in his head he still had to go and open the door to check. It was really surreal to watch how it affected him.While mental disorders can be triggered by substance abuse in people who already are predisposed to having one, I wouldn't say that most disorders are caused by it. Lots of people who live drug and alcohol-free lifestyles have disorders. False. But thanks for the sweeping and judgemental generalization of all of us that do struggle.I came here to say the same. Am considering studying medicine myself and it's really good to see someone with a mental illness going into it. I have depression and have wondered if I'll be able to cope. I guess self care, taking it slowly, etc, are how to do it.I am really grateful for what you are doing to try to reduce the stigma of mental illness. I have no problem with schizophrenics. Except I just don't believe your story. If you were definitively diagnosed, it's legally mandated that you disclose to the MD licensing board. Also, if you are taking any medication for it you legally have to disclose that information. If your instructor/advisor told you not to disclose he is breaking the law and so are you.Wow, as a current psych student this entire conversation is wonderful. Not to make you feel like I am getting entertainment out of your mental illness, I really just feel like this conversation has taught me a lot. I never really get the opportunity to hear from someone who is high-functioning schizophrenic. Like you said, there is a huge mental illness specifically around schizophrenia. 
Anyway- all of this was just to thank you guys for putting all this out onto the internet > I️ also have a family history of mental illness and autoimmune disorders on my maternal side... I️ have severe ADHD and generalized anxiety disorder, as well as migraines, Reynauds syndrome...

...you just described me, but instead of synesthesia I have all sorts of sleep issues and weird experiences around that. If you need case subjects for anything, hit me up because it sort of spooked me how close that was to describing myself and my family.

Off topic: What's your thesis? I'm a cog psych PhD tooI have synesthesia too (multiple types) and while synesthesia is often wonderful I find it does put some strain on my CPU.  
I also have chronic sleep disorder. I’ve basically slept a maximum of 4 hours a night for about 17 years. My record is 9 days with no sleep. I was absolutely off my nut. 
If I sleep I often wake up in a state of sleep paralysis. It used to scare me but I got used to it. 
When I was about 12 I used to doze off on the couch. When my mom would wake me to go to bed I would appear to be awake and yell and scream at her until she would leave me alone. I’d fall asleep for a few minutes and wake up alone on the couch and go to bed. The next morning I’d ask why she didn’t wake me up and she’d tell me what happened and I had no idea. Later I would experience it all but I would have no control over my actions. It was the creepiest thing ever. 
My mom is basically my best friend and I never had any reason to verbally abuse her like that. 

I suffer from anxiety, I’m depressed and I am slowly becoming more and more misanthropic. 

My family history contains a few cases of mental illness. 

I’m severely iron deficient because I’m a vegetarian but not very good at it. My blood pressure is too high. 

Today I worked 3 hours and went home crying. 10 hours of sleep in one week is not enough. Hey fellow Synesthete! What types do you have?

Also reading this thread, I'm beginning to realize that some of the cool feelings I get are actually types of somatic hallucinations. Also diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder as well. You mention Raynauds -- is that something you are diagnosed as by a doctor, or did you look it up? I've always suspected it (my fingers, toes, and nose are always cold, and my lips occasionally turn purple-blue) but it's never been an issue I'd think to go to a doctor and get a diagnosis.That sounds like a hell of a lot to deal with! Autoimmune encephalitis is a relatively newly recognized disorder, so I'm not sure there would be much literature on the relationship you've described. Hopefully in the future! https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4712273/Haha thank you! You guys have been so nice, I really appreciate it. That was my reaction! I've trialed a long string of antipsychotics from different classes with no benefit to my symptoms, and was termed treatment-resistant. I wonder if it's because the treatment I needed was corticosteroids for an autoimmune process. 

It's certainly something important to keep in mind for treatment-resistant patients. Lupus can do pretty much anything it wants to do. Compared to other psychiatric diagnoses, there is a higher prevalence of depressive and anxiety disorders among those with SLE (just like in the general population). Depression is frequently associated with inflammation/inflammatory conditions. I've seen SLE cause catatonia as well, but that was a rather clear case of lupus encephalitis. Not sure about "gut"... maybe you meant "gout'.I haven't heard about that. Sounds fascinating! I blame mobile lolThe what-if scenarios have been a common question. Every doctor has a present or past medical condition - it's about how they manage their condition. Competency depends on a large variety  of factors. 

My doctor has Crohn's disease. He theoretically could develop peritonitis while in the middle of giving me a subcutaneous injection, double over in pain, lose his grip, and cause the needle snap off inside my arm. That needle could then cause an abscess, and I'd lose my arm. 

It's just very, very unlikely. ah so that's the ball of your foot.  I thought the ball of your foot was the heel part.  

btw, I don't have any psychological disorder, just commenting on the walk since it was so interesting to me.

I tried walking with heel touching ground first, but I found it so annoying to have to retrain myself to walk "correctly" so instead I wear pumas that hug the sides of my feet and don't have really cushiony soles and no more rolled ankles!

But... that's the easy way out... Maybe I'll train myself to walk heel first and give it a try.Sucks to hear dude but we all do wierd shit I guess who cares and yea I don't want to make you feel uncomfortable or anything but I actually do have some questions...

How bad is the paranoia?
 I've had bad paranoia in the past (stayed up till 1am one night looking out my window because I was certain someone was gonna break into my car seemed normal at the time) but it seems to be mild now just peeking over my shoulder making sure nobody us trying to rob me

What were your first symptoms and at what point did you reach out for help?

I feel like I've bottled up mental health for too long I'm just tired and feel like I'm going to have a breakdown or is it a psychotic break?

Do you have personality issues at all? How bad?

I feel like I have little to no personality at all been going on for awhile but I feel like a can't help it I'm different everyday depending on who I'm with (right now I feel like I'm reddit average Joe ) I'm just typing how everyone else types using big words lol all formal this isn't how I am irl

Did weed trigger any mental health issues? 

I feel like thats what did it to me smoking at 12 ive just fucked my brain and developed alot of shit overtime I didn't notice at first like depersonalization


Sorry for the 21questions but I would really apperciate it if you answered and hope I didn't make you uncomfortable> people somehow wearing their skin.

Yelp. I'm sitting in a dark room reading this. Nopenopenope.


My symptoms were a bit stronger than yours, and they affected my childhood very strongly. Idk, kids and their brains are weird.There is a name for this:

[The Capgras Delusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capgras_delusion)I had the same "accidentally sell my soul" heavy worry; also, i thought for a long time that everyone else was some kind of alien watching and diagnosing me; even my parents and family.

But i haven't been diagnosed with any mental disorder; yet...
I think i'm pretty normal, now that i'm older.I used to be terrifiied of this. I sometimes slept in my mom's bed with her because she had a heating blanket and my dad worked in another city during the week. I would be so afraid to turn over and look, spending hours awake just scared stiff. Sometimes I still have trouble making myself touch my husband or daughter when they are sleeping. 

It was always an insect inside them instead of another person, some kind of praying mantis/roach hybrid. I just knew their face would be more angular and their eyes would be glossier and that's how I would know it had happened.It is a real bitch. I often think I have some form of it (OCD). I often have song lyrics running through my head all day into the hours of the night. Generally it's a part of a song, like the chorus, and I'll just keep running the same thing through my mind, over and over again. I'll wake up and my first thought will be what was that song I was thinking of? It's so annoying. This only started within the last four years, so I'm not sure what exactly triggered it, but I have to be real careful about what I listen to during the day/before I go to bed. I've never been medicated for it before, and since I can talk myself out of almost anything I've been pretty lax about talking to someone about it,  but it sure is annoying. I was diagnosed with ocd when I was postpartum.  I thought I was going to end up in an institution because I felt so out of control.  Looking back I had it my entire life, but never knew it was abnormal.  It still becomes an issue at times but knowing what was going on was such a relief.  Its crazy how different it is than people typically think.I’m happy to hear that! That’s so ridiculous that those other doctors wouldn’t listen to you, a mother always knows her child best. That can be anxiety - but that's the thing, it could be anxiety or something else - symptoms often overlap and only a professional would be able to assess it. 

If you've noticed it's getting worse then I'd definitely recommend getting it checked out. With some conditions it can deteriorate and become serious quickly so always best to be safe. 

All the best and hopefully it's nothing serious - if it is though at least you'll be able to proactively address and minimise it.That's good. I hope you can find someone you're comfortable talking to soon. Good luck!Thank you for sharing, this is both incredibly interesting and terrifying :\Awesome. :)

The thing is, i could keep asking why all day and at some point it will come to the root question of whos decision it was to make it that way - or why its given that it is that way.

Why is electricity there at all? Why is there current, potential differences and voltages? 

I hope you understand what i mean.

Science can answer the why in a specific case but not the general why.Why should there be a "Why?" if there is noone making a decision?

I might be wrong, but i dont see an answer to the why anywhere, not even slightly.

You can say "big bang happened", but why did it happen? Why was there a need for it to happen?Well, i for myself know god created pi, but i dont know why he did that, but i dont have to know anymore, when i know the one who created it.Assuming the universe is empty is a very bold statement [removed][removed][removed]I just want to kill myself before I deteriorate past the point of being able to commit suicide. I read a book about Alzheimer's where the patient, a woman named Alice, had prepared barbiturates and a note to herself telling her to take them when the illness had progressed to the point that she couldn't answer several listed questions. However, Alice deteriorates to the point she cannot follow the plan she had intended for herself and is instead forced to linger on as someone not really herself anymore. That's so damn frightening. Damn, that's heavy. I don't know if it is a bless or a curse to understand these things as you do.

My closest contact with a degenerative brain is my girlfriend's grandfather who lives with her. I've never had much contact with him but to see how hollow his presence became so very slowly is unsettling.

The only person I've met that had a stroke has a rather tragic case. He can only say a single word now although he can still communicate with tone and facial expression. To think that all his vocabulary but the equivalent of "fuck" (as a swear) in my language got whipped out of him while he still has communication internalized is so dark.My god, that is so frightening.I’m not all too familiar with bipolar disorder, can you explain the symptoms? I am humanizing the issue because most people believe in the horror movie stereotypes about schizophrenia. The truth is that one in four people in the United States is affected by mental illness. Schizophrenia in particular affects about one out of a hundred people, so most Americans went to high school with a handful of schizophrenics.

It is absurd to consider the lives of all of those people 'a hell you can't escape.'down boy[removed][removed][removed][removed][removed]I do the same thing, but I do it compulsively and not for the same reasons. It annoys the hell out of me. I usually get frustrated and think to myself "why the fuck do I need to explain my own thoughts to myself?"Oh my god, I do this, usually into a reflection and I think but just mime the words for some reason. I dunno, I pretend like I am audience like I'm in YouTube. it helps me vent, think about how I'm feeling and organise my thoughts. But my god I get sidetrackedYep. Even better for me because I have social anxiety. I can talk in my head with my fucking self for hours about nothing. But striking up a conversation with a stranger is one of the hardest things in the world. Being officially 'diagnosed' with schizophrenia does not change your personality/mental state. 

There is nothing to worry about because whatever you may or may not have will stay the same.

I think society hides from schizophrenia (and mental illness in general) because deep down even the healthiest individual can relate to/shows signs of aspects of mental illnesses.

It is important to see mental health as a spectrum, every individual places at some point on it - some further towards illness than others.I was unaware, mostly due to my focus on my fathers illness!  Do you have a source by chance? 

And you're....(wink wink) right! My thumbs and brain don't function well in the morning 👌
In that case... cue*https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PareidoliaNo worries mate. Be careful though lol, you can spend hours listening to absolutely incredible stories from many people who have died and come back. People who are clearly not liars, from everyday people to surgeons and from rich and poor alike - amazing accounts describing not only things they experienced out of their body but very accurate descriptions of things they witnessed which they could not have otherwise known.

Here's a link to a neurosurgeon's accounts of what he experienced while 'dead' from meningitis.

It's most definitely a self regulating behaviour for most people. It usually starts to show up in adolescence when people start to get a sense for social standards and pressure to act certain ways. Like practice for when people actually *are* watching you.Excellent posts! Not to mention all the cultural stuff, and different narratives and meanings people attach to health, intervention, symptoms etc. 

I don't have mental health problems but Ehlers Danlos (connective tissue disorder). I went to the EDS support group once (edit: this was supposed to help us live with a chronic condition/pain), and it was completely incompatible with my ideas on what it means to have EDS etc. I had a completely different narrative on health etc. due to my different cultural set-up.

Same, if you have some knowledge of cross-cultural psychiatry, the way people experience and interpret their problems is also to a certain extent culture specific. For example, tolerance for depresion may differ. There was a good scene in one of the Sue Townsend's book:

Adrian Mole: I am depressed.
Polish doctor: so what? Life is sad

Edit: there was a cultural shift in the West in the recent years to treat all signs of sadness as something that requires intervention. But sadness is a part of life. >You see schizophrenia is generally related to disfunction in the dopamine and serotonin systems

Do you have any recent citations for this? Most modern research acknowledges that we actually have no idea what causes schizophrenia. For example, rates of schizophrenia are twice as high in cities than in suburban or rural environments. That blows a pretty big hole through the idea that schizophrenia just comes from a single neurotransmitter issue. Schizophrenia and other mental illnesses are also hugely correlated with traumatic experiences in childhood, more so than any other single factor.

In philosophy, they say that everything follows from a false premise. That's what's happening here. Sure, you can rationalize your beliefs if you think that schizophrenia = neurotransmitter issue, but the reality is far more complicated than that. Therefore, analysis and treatment should be far more nuanced than simply prescribing anti-psychotics as the easy, legally defensible way out.> pluviophile

this is a fantastic word; thank you.A moment of irony, but that may not have been a hallucination. Sometimes rain happens in small areas, doesn't effect others, so maybe for a moment it rained in a small area and didin't effect others. So many accounts have documented this. It's why you sometimes see pictures or even drive and suddenly it looks like the sky is falling on 1 little area, and then suddenly it disappears. 

I'm not trying to play down any disorders. My mother suffers with hard to diagnose Schizoaffective disorder. She used to laugh to herself all the time while watching the Trinity Broadcasting Network. I'd ask her why she's laughing and she'd tell me some story about her life about someone I'd never heard of in my 30yrs on this earth about someone she knew or claimed to know years earlier. Her own mother had it, seems to skip a generation. It's probably why I'm not going to have kids, atleast some of my own, because her mother was every bit as bad as she is today.It's about balance. My schizophrenia means that I might be out of commission for about three days each month during an episode. I'm not going to restructure my life or take psychiatric medication to reclaim like 40 hours a month.

I was on psychiatric meds for a long time and they eventually ran out of things to put me on. Psychiatric drugs are no joke, and they can be fatal even with perfect use. In my case, I experienced insomnia, daily vomiting, worsened delusions (fun trying to convince the doctor about that one), the beginnings of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, dangerously low blood pressure, fainting, and seizures. You know what's way more dangerous than staying in my bed for a long weekend each month? Random seizures in a person without a history of them. If I had had a seizure while driving, it would have killed me a whole lot faster than schizophrenia ever would. In my case, self-sequestration *is* the safest option.Nope, and that's really neither of our faults. The fact is that the average person simply doesn't know how to deal with someone experiencing a psychotic break. I've tried reaching out for help in the past, but I end up having to micromanage the other person's feelings on top of my own.

For example, I had one 'friend' who was very outspoken about her anxiety and routinely came to our group of friends asking for help dealing with it. When I went to her for help during a psychotic episode, she told me that I was scaring her and she had no idea what to do. She later said 'You cant expect me to know how to deal with something I never have before. Its ok to teach me.'

It is fucking ridiculous to expect someone in the midst of a psychiatric emergency to both be dangerously sick and also level-headed enough to explain how to fix it. It's the medical equivalent of having to explain how to suture a wound while you're on the ground bleeding with gravel in your skin.

I use that girl as an example because it's such a perfect little capsule of the attitudes I encounter. Basically everyone I have ever asked for help while struggling has responded with their own version of 'Okay, I will help you as long as you calm down, stop being sick, and tell me what to do to help you.' It's emotionally unbearable. When I'm sick, my priority needs to be me.

I do have hope for the future that I can continue to educate people and (hopefully) write blog posts and create videos about how to support someone in psychosis. But at this point, in my life, the best thing for me to do during an episode is to sequester myself until it passes.>Have replaced "very" with "somewhat accurate" to potentially assuage some of your misgivings.

No misgivings :) Just like to use conversational footholds to elaborate on interesting points!the shadow people suggesting creative makeup is really funny to me. thanks for telling your story!

>In short, I think it's important for people to realize that schizophrenia isn't the only disorder that comes with hallucinations. I've found that knowing what's happening (basically, your brain misfiring like a beat-up car) 

Agreed, I used to have minor visual hallucinations (movement in my peripheral when in a still classroom for instance) that seem to have been brought on by the medications I was on growing up (I had an evolving diagnosis of ADD/ADHD OCD and bipolar among others until they finally realized it was Asperger's). I only figured out it was because of the meds because they stopped after I got off of them.

At the time I didn't even realize it was unusual.

Edit: I feel I should elaborate that when I say movement I mean that it was like someone or something would walk by briefly, it was like an eye floater I could see it but never get good look at it.I am glad my words helped. You are definitely not alone! I will concede that meds are sometimes forced on people, and I was short-sighted to say otherwise. However, I really believe it is important to learn as much about any diagnosis as possible, through independent research. Being an informed patient has helped me greatly. Adderall could potentially be bad for these symptoms. Seriously, be honest with your doctors. You seem to be functioning normally and presumably aren't a danger to yourself or others, so you will not be sectioned or anything. So it's all your own private medical info that you never have to disclose to anyone other than your doctors if you don't want to.

But seriously, don't risk letting it go. If it did get worse, you would need a high dose of medication to fix it, and that's not what you want if you can avoid it. And if you have a psychiatrist or psychologist that knows your history, you have someone to go to quickly if your symptoms ever do get worse.Everything you listed can also be attributed to Adderall side effectsResearch into schizophrenia is really moving forward and we might even have a cure in the next 10 years so getting a diagnoses might not be as bad as it seems. [An example](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/nov/03/radical-new-approach-to-schizophrenia-treatment-begins-trial)I would disagree to some extent. While the diagnosis may not be pertinent now, later on down the road that information can aid medical professionals with decisions should something happen.>But seriously, if it's not affecting your ability to live normally, it's not worth diagnosing

This could be the worst medical advice in the thread. The point of medical intervention is to try to seek treatment **before** a symptom turns into a larger problem.  Absolutely do not wait if you think you might be suffering from hallucinations.  The key to many successful treatments is early diagnosisI get your sentiment; however just because you’ve accepted as normal does not mean it’s not affected your life. For example, while I was going through a bout of bad OCD, I thought my obsessions and compulsions were normal behavior, or at least nothing that serious. However, it was incredibly difficult for me to function with so many intrusive thoughts and compulsions. I didn’t know it was something I didn’t have to keep just living with. It wasn’t until I realized that my obsessions, compulsions, and behavior were not normal that I could get help and learn how to actually deal with them. And it’s not that they go away completely, they’re just actually manageable now; I also don’t feel like I’m losing my mind> if it's not affecting your ability to live normally, it's not worth diagnosing.

No, no, no.

No one reading this should listen to this advice. It's like saying that minor ache in your tooth is pretty tolerable, so no need to get it checked out. It may develop into a bad, painful infection later, and one that could be dangerous.

If you have symptoms of schizophrenia, get checked out. Better to know if there is an issue *now* than to discover it only after you have a full, unexpected episode that puts you or others in danger. There's no shame in it.Why did I read this in the voice of Drunk Uncle?That is terrible adviceI mean,  cancer doesn't always affect your ability to live normally until it gets so bad you risk death,   so I gotta disagree,  that's a pretty stupid thing to say. It's always worth diagnosing if it has the potential to get worse. You joke,  but as a doctor, there are countless examples of people doing just that. It's good that people ask questions and care about their mental health. You should probably get checked out too.true, but the main point is that it is *not* normal, and this person should seek professional helpGoogle Martha Mitchell EffectThis is a useless post and doesn't help baconbake in any way. Next time you want to state a counterargument, try posting some concrete examples. "It's probably a bunch of other things instead" is not an argument and only wastes people's time. Stop attributing your disorder to the paranormal and get psychiatric help. [deleted]Hes talking about the Pineal Gland, which sits near the center of your brain. Its actually pretty interesting shit if you can get past the hippy aspect of it.

Its believed to produce DMT, which is a hallucinogenic chemical. Alot of Scientist believe that it slowly releases DMT during heavy REM sleep, which is what causes you to dream. Essentially, you are tripping while you sleep. Its also believed to have a large part in the creation of Serotonin, the chemical that is released when you are happy. Apparently your body also releases DMT shortly after you are born, and right when you die. There is also data that suggests that DMT production rises in patients suffering from forms of psychosis. You can also see alot of ancient artwork from every corner of the world that depicts the Pineal gland. Also, random side note; its proven that fluoride does alot of Damage to the Pineal Gland.

It also comes up alot when people talk about The Stoned Ape theory, and the evolution of Human Consciousness. 

"We literally know how the brain works" 
Yea, except that we don't. And we are 20 years away. And have been 20 years away for 40 yearsWhen my daughter is sleeping so I decide to shower... She's always screaming or calling for me until the shower is off. Worst feeling to makes yourself ignore. Never once has she been awake, and yet I always check. That actually sounds pretty normal. I definitely don't have schizophrenia, but I do have a very musical mind and sometimes my brain just "fills in the gaps" with a melody on top of background noise while I'm doing some other trivial task, like commenting on Reddit. 

The real problem is when you have the intrusive sounds day-to-day, not just when your brain is primed to make sense of something by filling in missing pieces. We're very highly evolved creatures and it's natural to have an unconscious yearning for completeness & order. 

Edit: [here's a different thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/7cpmd8/serious_people_that_have_been_diagnosed_with/dpsa2ph/) in the discussion that mentions the same thingMe too! Every time I shower if I don’t have purposeful music on I always hear a door or something. Then it sounds like the neighbors have music on. Now I just listen to music in the shower.
Same at night with the white noise , same white noise each night but sometimes I hear wind chimes, sometimes I hear singing bowls, and every now and then I hear a particular classical piece by Handel which is weird Bc my mom never listened to any of those things. I never heard classical music outside of looney tunes or hymns until I was in my late teens. I don’t even like the Handel I hear it’s like “ ok brain can we change the channel??”  So it switches to the full “‘magic school bus” theme song on repeat. -_- not better Some times when I take a shower, I I'd swear I hear my mom calling... She lives over 200. Kilometers awayI used to hear somebody yelling "hey!" Very load and angry at me while I was taking a shower. I would get started and almost fall so I had to leave the curtain open to assure myself that know one was actually right behind it.
It started all at once only during a shower lasted for about 2 weeks and hasn't happened again since.Me too! With the fan! It sounds like incredibly soft, distant piano chords and tweaks me out!!I hear things in the shower and the heavy rain and especially whilst vacuuming. It's never bothered me and I believe it is normal. The most common sound is thinking someone called my name although I hear other voices but can't tell what they are saying. Sounds like you are listening more intently to the ambient sounds, in that new calm environment in bed. Maybe your brain is doing the same thing I described, finding recognizable patterns in the ambient noise? Or it could just be the acid. That sounds like someone needs to test that theory by playing high pitched noises to their kids!  Maybe if they hear it often they will retain the function.might have to load up Pokemon Red on my 3DS and see if it sounds any different. I'm 27 now.To be fair, the Pokemon games have  bombass soundtracks.get out of my head!Wow, I've never heard of "musical ear syndrome." It's great to know that you aren't alone in what you're going through.Eh, I use sir a lot like dude, no offense intended. But I do mean what I said. Imagine how insane Beethoven must have felt. I've always just assumed I'm insane. My anxiety is so bad now, I'll probably lose my insanity.
This happens to me. With the exception to the demon-like distortion. I hear what can only be described as someone speaking another language- and I’m torn between trying to take my brain somewhere where it stops- but at the same time- my imagination will take off with it...I think your assumption that it’s a side effect of your meds sounds likely because changing/starting/tapering off meds causes your existing symptoms to flare up or intensify. But am not a doctor!! My gut reaction was uh-uh but like I said my experience has been different. YMMV. Do you need attention too. Catch it early.I get in chats with him if he's interested l, no too much other people is willing to so thats nice. He comes and goes, almost feel like a different entity. I can get him here but it also depends on his will. He looks like a more ideal me. He grew a bit overtime. His voice hasn't change, its a mid-teen voice even though he appears in his early 20s like me. Oh cool, I didn't know that had a name. I get the yelling of my name sometimes as I'm falling asleep, and sometimes just a deafening SNAP that isn't quite a real sound, but a terribly loud... sensation.

It sure wakes me up. Nope, phased right through him a few times, and nobody else can hear him. So either he is imaginary or I am a new rare specie. [removed]Didn't both him and his wife die in that crash? That's insane if so. No pun intended The film still depicted that he learned how to cope with his condition and was working in the field. Of course, the film maybe more dramatic about things because... it's a film. It's supposed to be entertaining. In real life... My father was paranoid schizophrenic. I remember him beating on my mom and talking about a electric chair out in the front yard. He would also carry sharpened screwdrivers. Yep, he did not have visual hallucinations.  Only auditory. He did not retire, he was in a cab on the way back from an airport from a conference he spoke at.[deleted]That's exactly how I remembered it, but just went back and watched that scene and she rips off the back of the mailbox and it fades out. She then walks into the psych ward to see Nash. They talk for a while and then she pulls out all the classified info he dropped and it's all still in the sealed envelopes.The other thing that no one seems to have mentioned is that Nash's family life didn't work out either. He and his wife divorced, though they did remain friends, he lived with her as a boarder for awhile, and I think (?) reconciled muuuuch later. Both his career and his marriage/family floundered due to his illness, and it was years before either of those recovered at all. In the movie, you see his wife staunchly standing by him through his illness and recovery, even though it meant working full-time, doing all the home and childcare because he was too spaced out, and no sex life with her husband due to his meds. In real life, she divorced and I don't think anyone blamed her for doing so.Yes. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Forbes_Nash_Jr.Yes. He did in fact win a nobel prize in economics, for real. Developed Nash equilibrium and Game Theory. He was a serious math genius. He just also happened to be schizophrenic and had some difficulty telling reality from fantasy.[removed]Forgot about that one. I was trying to place the voices in The Beach Anyone mention that guy M Night ShalamalalamalmalDingDong? The Gangs of Aviator Island 2: Wally Wolf's Grape Diaries.


🎺BWAAAAAAM BWAAAAAM🎺Yeah I'll second that recommendation.  By itself it's a wonderful series, Skarsgard is amazing in it.  It's not my normal cup of tea but I was on a police detective kick and watched it without reading anything the critics said and was very pleasantly surprised.I like how in Legion, they make you question if certain episodes, or even the whole series, take place in his mind. He could still actually be schizophrenic, but he imagines he’s a mutant. Oh is that what that show is about? i didn't get it after watching an entire season lolI think so as well! I relate way too strongly with Elliott's experiences and reactions much of the time. Sometimes it's so eerie that I try not to show how familiar it is because I don't want to freak out my partner with the implications about my head (we watch it together).No that’s not what that show is aboutYeah. Wife's uncle had a bad stretch a few decades ago. Called the cops on relatives he believed were trying to kill him. Because he could hear them thinking. We were on a train from Amsterdam to Prague with him and he nearly got us tossed off because he was arguing with me based on stuff I wasn't saying (but he was hearing) and confusing the hell out of us. It's not entertainment material really. Not if it's done accurately. Yeah, I read what you said. I don't think you understand the topic well enough based largely on the fact that you said it.You've got this, homie. :) Same thing with me. I generally has a poor memory and seem to remember dreams better than real life, so I can't always remember what conversations happened. I'm only 31, but I assume it's either normal or some kind of early onset dementia and not schizophrenia. Same, dude. Fuck genetics.I don't want to say that your post has given me schizophrenia, but does your post make sense? Thanks. My understanding is it's pretty common but I'm no expert. It happens to me too. But I also start dreaming before I'm actually asleep too. Totally.  I hear crying or "mommy!"  in my head even when all is quiet.  So annoying!Trippy! Wow that's horrible, but you must be used to the spiders by now I'd assume! 😉I would think so--I get the same thing (assuming you mean, in the course of falling asleep). I think of it as like if you were flipping through the channels on the TV, where you just get snippets of phrases without knowing their context. Usually it's not things I've ever actually heard.I think this is a form of auditory [Tetris effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_effect)Hello, I'm Dr. Internet, and you have Narrator Syndrome™For the second part of your comment, to me this sounds more like a [hypnagogic hallucination](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnagogia) than anything else. It’s quite comment to hear/see/experience things when you’re on the edge of sleep; I’ve even heard my name being shouted in a panicked tone once when I was falling asleep.

So that’s much less sinister a cause than schizophrenia :)I've had things like that happen, especially before falling asleep. It legitimately sounds like someone in the room is talking to me. 


So I kiiiiind of, maybe can imagine what people with schizophrenia might be experiencing. It’s given me a different way of thinking about mental illness for sure.

Doesn’t bother me anymore. I don’t talk to my mom often, lots of other examples like I mentioned led to that. It’s more than awkward for me. I can’t have a good conversation with her. 

My younger sibling helps take care of her (I live thousands of miles away), and I literally can’t tell my mom about a lot of things I do because they’re triggers for her.

At least that’s what I’ve been told.Thank you! Yeah, the mood swings got a bit.. intense, and it was then I noticed the worst of the voices. Once the menopausal penny dropped, the relief was instantaneous - I did think I was losing my mind at one point.There doesn't seem to be any relation between the voices and my outside life.I understand. Like, I wouldn't wish it on anyone but I don't know if I would change it about myself.[deleted][removed]Basically this.. I'm surprised people are surprised.. But then i didn't grow up in an orphanage or post apocalyptic hellscape.My brother was diagnosed schizophrenic. He got on meds and was doing the best he had in years and was seemingly very normal. I was even his roommate which would've been an idea I couldn't even grasp a year or two prior. Then His psychologist (psychiatrist? Not sure which prescribes the meds) prescribed him adderall seemingly out of the blue. He killed himself 2 years ago and while we were going through his things we discovered he had taken all his adderall. I really do think there was a correlation between that and his schizophrenia to this day. 

Sorry if this isn't clear, I'm tired in bed. My son is on amphetamines for his ADHD and I worry about this. People are misdiagnosed with schizophrenia when they have actually just been on amphetamines. But this is something you should not have to worry about if you need it as a daily. Did you tell your doc? As a mom, like I said I am so worried about this! But my son functions so much better in school with it. I am on amphetamines for ADHD. No real issues with psychosis. My older brother got bad when he was on them.Amphetamines increase, among other neuro-transmitters, the level of dopamine. Most Anti-psychotics decrease the level of dopamine in order to reduce psychosis. Extremely high dopamine levels, especially out of balance with other neurotransmitters, can cause psychosis. SameMy concerta really made me angry and irritable, i also got more depressed. Makes sense though cause my doctor was careless. I was on nearly 200mg per dayActually this is quite common for amphetamines abusers especially, to be misdiagnosed with schizophrenia. ADHD symptoms are frequently seen in many disorders as you mentioned, which leads to frequent misdiagnosis and lack of treatment, especially in kiddos. Typically, schizophrenics are diagnosed by age 25. My dad was 27, and I am 26. It kinda sits in the back of my brain and wakes me up some nights, but I do my best to avoid thinking about it and just go about my day.I took Ritalin as a child and I can't say much about hallucinations but I have Tourette's syndrome because of it now. I could have had hallucinations but I'm not sure I was quite young. This is really interesting! Thanks you guys. This is true, but typically this is for those who are using in high doses or chronically abusing. OP could be that small number that reacts differently to the stimulants, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it wasn’t more likely that OP was using the stimulants which worked against his underlying schizophrenia he may/may not have. The stimulants just worsened his symptoms of psychosis possibly. Wow you must be a fuckin doctorTrue, many people suffer from comorbid conditions, or dual diagnosis. ESP involving substance abuse, and frequently you add medications to treat one symptom but they cause another diagnosis! Well that's what I figured but quite a few others  here think they know something your doctors don't!Yeah that sounds reasonable. Just seemed unlikely they'd miss something that obvious (assuming he was even on meds at the time.) You're right that we really don't know anything  about the quality  of the treatment he received. Other than it seemed to help a lot, which is a good sign. I am not schizophrenic, but I have had rare auditory hallucinations when waking or falling asleep and I've read that it's pretty normal and not an indication of any mental illness.

It sounds exactly like an actual person is in my bedroom saying something to me. It's always been the voice of someone I know well. Then I wake up fully and of course they aren't there.I could swear a lot of schizophrenics have just that issue but they are really lonely and stressed out at one time in their lives. They start talking to themselves and start thinking that there is another person talking to them and forget how to control their inner monologue. They then tell someone who isn't quite on board with that's is going on and people get scared and think they are nuts and reject them and they get even more lonely and the cycle continues.Yeah, as long as you recognize it fully as your own and can direct it, not a problem. I have a near-constant inner monologue. I just think exclusively in words and I'm almost already thinking about something. I actually can't even see pictures in my head like most people, so all I have is words.Yeah I've had that too, my internal monologue can be affected by who I've been hearing speak, or who I admire. But it's always my thoughts, projected as another voice. I can change that voice at will sometimes to emulate characters if I'm reading a book too, like I can get it to "sound" like Elijah Wood if I'm reading The Lord of the Rings. The brain is a bizarre place.When I took a database design class, it really clicked for me. Everything I read, every conversation I had just started diagramming itself into a data model in my head.  The effect faded over time fortunately, so now I have a more normal interior dialogue unless I deliberately them on data diagramming mode. I started thinking in my advisor's voice a few weeks ago and it was so funny. He's from Spain and I'm a woman from the US, so it was amusing to think in a male voice with an accent for a few days.Odd to me cause I do have an internal monologue that I experience pretty much constantly.I'm not just talking about physically hurting someone. You can ruin a person's life with words and actions. Check on those 'stats'.I posed the theory on r/schizophrenia. Not many replies but the one who did understood the basics of what I was saying when I related a time I was in a ward (no hazard, was being monitored while tapering off most Meds and undergoing ECT {also: if you love someone at All, DONT let them go through that! Destroyed my long term memory and more and Zero benefit. Plus flashbacks and nightmares}). One other schizophrenic guy was admitted, low functioning. Never spoke to anyone. Then in TV room he began asking me questions. Everyone else looked confused as heck. The two of us talked (almost identical to “twin speak”) for 5 minutes. Seemed to understand each other. No one else in the room did. Supports my theory. I’d like to see a study done on it...That was my experience with it, yeah. After I hit a certain point in dose, the sleepiness stayed the same. It was still totally absurd, even for the teenager I was at the time haha. I'm just glad I didn't stay on it any longer than I did. That stuff can really fuck you up.That's EXACTLY what being on seroquel is like: you're never fully awake or alert. Like you my doctor didn't really explain much to me either, just told me it'd help me get some sleep. In fact, none of my doctors ever explained the nasty side effects unless there was a high chance I'd go into that toxic overdose thing. I forget what its called. It always irks me when people say oh just go back to meds, like do you know what you're asking me to do? If I'm not a danger to myself or others I'll ride the med free train as long as I can. Anxiety, mood swings, depression, manic/depressive episodes. ADHD caused them all.Well right, that’s what I’m saying. It was worded needlessly aggressively. You're not even texting while doing it? It's almost like you're not even trying. [deleted]Technically yall are both right.  Schizophrenics are more likely to be a victim of a hate crime than a perpetrator of a crime but the guy he is replying to definitely needs to seek help. I know that is being nitpicky but I'm just correcting both sides here. Right! My thoughts exactly. Smh. Sometimes it takes time and trial & error to get someone's psych meds right. 😒

Source: am a person diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder Type 1, generalized anxiety disorder, and PTSD. I'm currently on a regimen of medication that has done wonders for me (lithium, lamictal, & gabapentin), but it took a few years of tweaking to get me there. Trying many different meds was frustrating and sucked, but was totally worth it to find the right ones. Without my meds, I'd be a totally different person, maybe even dead, and definitely miserable, depressed, and difficult to be around. 

I've also accepted that I'll probably be on medication for life, and that's OKAY. Antagonizing someone is not the way to reach out to them. So you aren't helping either.Your responses aren't productive, is the problem. Can you imagine receiving the message you sent, about any topic, and actually changing your actions? If your answer is "yes", you are lying to yourself. I think the vast majority of people here agree that the user should take his meds. What you said, though, wasn't said in a way that is at all likely to cause that. It was inflammatory and upsetting, and if anything will lead to the poster becoming defensive in response and not listening to other people suggesting he take his meds. You can disagree with me all you want but it's well documented. [deleted]What psychologist in your area prescribes meds? I've only met psychiatrists who do that :P And only one described me as a fire thank you, which was awhile ago. And it they clearly thought I was a danger to others or myself I'd be put in a hold. Not a choke hold either lol. I don't "need" to keep doing anything that interferes with my quality of life. Thank you for your concern, but I'm good. >you're the crazy one here

That's pretty mean and not very constructive to say. Don't mean this in a hostile tone towards you but maaan if I had schizophrenia and I read that, I would feel like garbage. It's exactly the kind of language that has effectively shut out people with mental disorders from society...tough crowd lmao. It was meant to be taken lightly, not that serious dude. And some don't and are fine. Believe what you want, but I'm good. Except I don't, I know it's not real and don't engage. I know everyone wants to believe in a perfect world meds help everyone but truthfully they don't. And not every ill person is a danger to themselves or others. Other than a few weeks ago my condition has been level, and at one point I'd gone a year with no problematic symptoms. I don't self diagnose myself, I manage myself like everyone else in this thread does. I'll stick to therapy but nope, no meds. Hey! Just a quick warning (and I’m not sure if this is applicable with such a low dose) but lithium and hallucinogens do not mix. Instant seizure. As in 7/8 people tested had a seizure that would have been deadly had they not been in a controlled study with medical attention near immediately. If you take lithium wait at least one month before taking any hallucinogens!! Nowhere did I say "do not use lithium just because I had a bad experience." I'm stating the risks and responsibility involved, because you spoke of it in the same casual manner as the multi-vitamins. Again if it's a micro dose that's fine, but it's important to distinguish that and be informed about the substance in general.Haha, I also watched A Beautiful Mind in my AP Psych class. I think I remember my teacher saying it wasn't completely accurate.I really don't,  if I still had my report from high school psych ten years ago, I could point you toward something, but for now all I have is the reference I've  already  made.I'm not a medical practitioner, but I would say no, absolutely not. The early hallucinations were just less intense and more discernible because that was while my psychosis was beginning. *storm knocks out OP's power*I get sleep paralysis too, but weirdly rarely hallucinate with it. Just am awake and can’t move, sometimes with a feeling of terror.I feel like opening your eyes in the middle of the night and seeing someone standing staring at you at the foot of your bed would be decidedly *un*-fun. There’s a name for that! It’s called a hypnagogic hallucination, it’s really common.Nah, he thought it was hilarious. Also a bit strange.Oh I got that when I was a teen as well. I could never figure out how to sleep so I could see all around me.Most of the time I didn't experience any hallucinations either, but that was one of the few times I did.  I haven't experienced sleep paralysis in years, which might be because I consume more caffeine than I did before college; I've heard that decreases the frequency of episodes.

I'm curious though, how long were your episodes if you had enough time to get bored?  Mine never lasted more than a minute at most.I mean, it’s hard to convince your brain that a person standing in front of you isn’t real. It’s not like they somehow *look* like a hallucination, they look like a person standing thereI don't smoke weed or do anything like that regular, go years between smoking it, but the few times I have.. been some fun diversions.Tragic. So sorry. When a neurological issue decides to "take hold" it can cause significant changes in a short period of time.  

All it takes is something to "trigger" it to start.I completely agree. I hadn't considered that option when typing out my response but you are absolutely correctThat fool, everyone knows after two you chew, after three you freebase.You two are joking, right? Please tell me you're joking.I'm not super into ancestral energies and auras and stuff, but the difference in attitude alone is worth the click: Mental/emotional/spiritual crises are a thing that happens to people, it doesn't mean they're defective people, it can be worked with, it can even help to develop compassion and patience. People with odd minds still have a place.That's a fascinating point I had never really considered before. Thanks for sharing!Insight or lack thereof in regard to both mental condition and reality orientation is a pretty big hurdle for those in long term care.  Many of the people in the long term care facility I work for just consider this home, but remain hopeful that they will be able to live more independently one day.


There's a lot of trail and error that goes into long term care for schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders especially for those that don't respond well to typical drugs for psychosis. So just because a client is responding well to a treatment program now that doesn't mean those drugs will keep working indefinitely.   

Back to insight for level of care.... we really want to put our clients in the least restrictive placement for their level of symptoms.  Unfortunately, for many of the clients in our long term care this 24 hour locked facility is the best fit for them until they get to an advanced age where their physical health declines to a point where we can no longer care for 
them here.  

There was one at the psych hospital I worked at here in Canada. It was basically a permanent home for long-term alcoholics. These were people who were so severely addicted that they physically could not live without alcohol ever again. Their bodies had become so dependant on it that they would have seizures without it. Doctors would give them small "doses" of alcohol throughout the day, for the rest of their lives.

It was a small, separate little building that looked like it was maybe used as some sort of recreational club that had been turned into rooms. 

I picked up a client there once to take him to an introductory computer class. When I got there, he was a mess- incoherent and uncoordinated as he was sobering up. After his dosage, once we got to the class, he was totally different: focused, steady, speaking clearly and perfectly functional. It was amazing how the body had truly learned to need the alcohol to be able to function normally.It is in Texas, in East Texas to be specific. The man we spoke to said that there were only 15 beds though, so it might not be the same place.

I do know the people in the home were high functioning enough that they could be taken around town or allowed to go up and down the road if they had earned the privilege. They also had a neat little ticket system that they seemed enthused about.It is in Texas, in East Texas to be specific.

It's "The Hospitality House."In jails or homeless.  And we have Ronald Reagan to thank for it.> http://www.fourwindshospital.com/

Thank you!It's failing the kids. People want to do start-up's for water and pressed fruit juice because there might be a (I'd like 3 moneys please? leaving it) money in it 5 years from now. Open a chain of behavioral health and long term mental health institutions. These should give the people full access to doctors, meds, a place to come to be safe, and a place that won't turn them and the ones that care about them the most, away. Obviously those are general ideas but all you need is love, and a whole truck-load of money. It's no pressed juice though. That's a consideration. I just think that with how hectic things are right now, moving to another country might do more harm than good. Perhaps if she can get into a place for 6-9 months we can move and then get set up there with a plan. Appreciate the advice, at this point all advice is something to consider rationally.I'm sorry to hear that your parents don't take it serious. I would love to make them know how it feels to face intrusive thoughts day in and day out for just one day and then see if they still had such a callous attitude about it. I can guarantee they wouldn't think so lightly of it anymore.Pobre bisabuella!It's all a grand spectrum of things. Thoughts and feelings and emotions and behaviors, right? Do you find the anxiety and depression treatments helpful?I feel that! If I couldn't slam my head into things, I'd punch myself in the head, or bite myself. Thankfully I don't do that anymore. 

Something I've always done to stop the bad thoughts is to uncontrollably repeat a sentence or a phrase at least three times. I can't really stop myself. My brain is a dickbag so I get a lot of very odd thoughts that occur almost constantly.Thank you!3-4 months... that’s so intense. yeah tbh its had me a little unhinged. but im chalking up to the long, hyper realistic dreams I've been having. These stories are scary. I can't imagine that happening to me. Seeing and hearing things that aren't there. Cool, that’s what I was assuming, but the comment i replied to just made me think. I have a plethora of mental ailments, I’m sure I’m not schizophrenic. 

Thank you :)I used to get these when I was taking beta blockers for chronic migraine! They escalated to where I’d see things, panic & turn on the lights in the middle of the night - someone in the room, a rat in the bed etc. At first my boyfriend (who lives with me) was all comforting me & rubbing my back until I snapped out of it. 

Then after he got sick of me waking him up in a panic he would say “You’re just hallucinating again”. Once replied with “OK but seriously THIS TIME it’s real”. Don’t think he’ll ever forget what he calls ‘ the time you tried to convince me that there was a tiny robot on the bedside table.’Would you happen to know more about this? Hear snatches of music or faint whispers right when I'm about to sleep. If anything they make me feel more comfortable so. Possibly! I’ve struggled with sleep paralysis a lot before, but it’s rare to happen now unless I miss a dose of my usual meds. 

But like... I know I’m not frozen. I’ve had auditory hallucinations from SP before. This just wakes me up and im very alert. 

It’s weird. Maybe it’s just my dreamsI didn’t know that. I have sleep disorders and anxiety... thanks for that the moment I hear any type of laughter I'm burning the house down.Agreed. People seem to be like how can a schizophrenic not know they are hallucinating it doesn't make sense to be hearing a voice when there's no body, but they don't get all the other symptoms that accompany the voice that makes it seem so real and perfectly normal...it's all part of the disorder.Oh God..... That made me shudder pretty violently. :/Actually for me it’s the opposite, I’m a cis gendered male and I find myself as a woman in most of my dreamsAs a cis gendered male, I also have these dreams. My thought was that it makes up the non-represented parts of your life that your mind wants to explore. When I'm dreaming that I'm a woman, I'm picturing being held and the like. It's something that rarely happens in real life.When you're a young child, you just deal with it and find ways not to be bored. Long drives were hellacious. Our trips to the beach when I was little were around 8 hours each way, so having little games and such were life savers. Having music helped. Being a voracious reader helped. My parents had no idea, and neither did my siblings. I thought it was all pretty normal.

Some things that others consider boring are pretty fun to me. I don't mind filing or doing some mindless tasks from time to time. I have a pretty decent imagination, and I had siblings to play with or get into fights with. ;)I did see that. I almost wish I could experience it. It's so hard to imagine[removed]All of that information is false for Australia.

Enclosed is my favourite book, some badges, and old medication. I keep the old medication that didn't work in a little music box at the bottom of my shelf to remind me of the past while I'm in the present. It's a weird momento, but it reminds me not to judge others since I was once a homeless kid who had dropped out of high school. Sometimes I do lose touch. I hope you can find some peace with your patients. https://imgur.com/a/EuQYY[removed]I also have cycles of bad insomnia. My record is five days without more than a few brief cat naps. I️ either don’t sleep at all, or sleep way too much; there is no in between. :/My first thesis was over how cognitive perspective affects eyewitness memory for officer-involved shootings/use of force. However, after being approved, running the study over multiple semesters, analyzing the data, and writing most of the paper, I️ unfortunately had a combination of personal health issues and issues with my lab/advisor that led me to scrap the project altogether. I’m now working on research over potential differences in cognition in people who are colorblind. I️ have synesthesia, and have long been fascinated about how the abnormal interconnectivity between brain regions that underlies it correlates with things like creativity, metaphorical thinking, etc.  I️ am looking at if/how colorblindness conversely correlates with “black and white” thinking (pun only kind of intended), differences in performance on projective assessments, etc.  It’s in the early stages, though. This is so weird. 

I️ do and have done the exact same thing when woken up. Well, I️ don’t yell, but I’ll have conversations and have no awareness of them whatsoever. My mom used to get so mad at me, til she realized I️ really wasn’t awake when it happened. 

And I’m also anemic/borderline anemic, depending on how good my diet is (or is not), and how consistent I️ am with taking iron supplements. 

Magnesium and vitamin D supplements have seemed to help a little, but not much. And I’m inconsistent with taking them. Hi! I️ have color-grapheme type and ordinal linguistic personification. I️ was actually thinking earlier how the personifications of letters, numbers, etc., that my mind creates (genders, personality types, good or bad, stuff like that) kind of reminds me of how some schizophrenics assign personalities to the voices in their heads. Makes me a little uneasy. Lol

I’m self-diagnosed re: the Reynauds. It’s impossible to miss if you have it. Lol... It’s really annoying and sometimes painful, and I know the stimulants I️ take for my ADHD make it worse, but it’s not a big enough deal to me to be treated for. I️ live in Texas, so I️t doesn’t get cold enough for long enough to be really dangerous. It’s trippy, though. My fingers on my left hand are the worst for some reason. They will without warning turn completely white, then purple, and go numb (sometimes all of them; sometimes only one or two). Then after a while, when I️ warm up or my blood just decides to start circulating properly again, they’ll turn bright, angry red, burn, swell, and itch like crazy for a while. Sometimes the swelling is so bad that it feels like the skin will burst open! 

Edit: Sorry for the annoying text issues. I️ need to update my phone. 😑Thanks. I have learnt a lot from this thread. 

 I meant digestive bacteria type things.It really is. I don’t know if it helped my feet much. My feet get sore easily, but that’s because I have very, very small feet with high arches, but I’m average height or maybe a bit shorter (female). I should try the toe walking again and see if it makes a difference. 

I kind of trained myself to do the heel first walking over 2 days. I was in a parade that went through an outdoor shopping strip. While I walked, I watched my reflection in the shop windows going past, so it was easy to see the difference. I just kept adjusting what I was doing so I looked the same as everyone else waking along. Watching at the same time made it pretty easy. For the next few weeks I just really paid attention to my feet and consciously walked heels down first. Then it just became a habit and I do it now without thinking about it. 

I suspect if I’d noticed when I was older, I wouldn’t have worried about it. But this group of girls at school noticed and asked me about it a few times (not mean, just curious and blunt) so I became really self conscious about it (I’d never noticed before) and wanted to ‘fix’ it. 

Because I’ve work with kids with disabilities (mainly autism, but others too) I’ve noticed a lot of autistic kids that do it. But not all of them. I have well managed depression, but beyond that I’m neurotypical (no other diagnoses). I have noticed a small number of neurotypical kids (a few who have siblings with autism) who toewalk as well. But as far as I know there are no studies or anything. So I can only tell you what I’ve seen, and not draw any wider conclusions or even theories. Thanks. I'm not uncomfortable, I don't mind talking. The paranoia was severe in the area of thinking people knew what I was thinking, it created a lot of anxiety. I can't really recall too many other instances where I was paranoid of people, like I said I can't really remember too much right now. 

My first symptoms were when I was 18. I was having an emotional break of some sort and I heard a woman's voice harshly asking me why I was sitting on my kitchen floor acting weird. Over the next two years thinks got consistently worse and eventually I took myself to a doctor at around 21 I think.

I think it's called a psychotic break if you have psychotic features with it, an emotional exhaustion with endless tears or depression may qualify as an emotional breakdown.

I actually just finished some testing at my therapists office and apparently I have a bit of Borderline personality disorder. I've never really had an identity, if I see something that someone else is really passionate about I'd get into, but I've always been lacking in my own personal individuality. I was researching bpd disorder and it's all a bit confusing, but I definitely have noticed some of the symptoms in myself. It doesn't interfere with my life very much, so I guess I can say it's mild.

I understand feeling like you have no personality, my mother told me once I was like a chameleon always changing who I was.

Weed seemed to mimic a psychotic disorder, but I could never be sure whether it was the scizhophrenia I was experiencing when I'd be overly paranoid or felt like I was on some deep connected level with everyone.

It's ok for all the questions, I like enlightening people and helping where I can, plus I like talking about it all, it's purging. And again no I'm not uncomfortable.

I do really want to apologize to you, I offered to sit and talk with you but I just got smacked with a heavy wave of sleepy, because Im normally asleep by now. If you feel up to it and want to continue talking just message me back and I'll respond tomorrow. Good night!(Not OP) You can reach out for help any time you need help, buddy. You don't have to ask for permission to ask for help! 

***Firstly: You are probably going to be fine.*** 

Your brain does not appear to be fucked up.  After all, you're still smart enough to recognize a familiar pattern, empathize, relate back to your personal experience and ask meaningful questions. If you had REALLY fucked your brain it would be happy with television. But, just to be on the safe side, maybe calm down with the pot. Once your get into your early-mid 20s the risk to your brain is much lower.

It is possible that you are not having a breakdown, you just have energy to burn off, stuff you've been carrying around that is weighing you down.  If you can't carry it, it's ok to put it down. If you can't cope, it's ok to say so. 

The truth is that everyone has lots of little breakdowns throughout their life. How we deal with them depends on our experience and who we have to help us through them. 

 I recommend dancing around the kitchen, cross training, screaming into pillows and then throwing them at walls, and (if I'm really stressed) MMO games in which you can crush your enemies.  I also highly recommend physically experiencing as much art and live music as possible. There is a whole load of gorgeous, crazy, mindbending stuff out there created by people with all sorts of perceptions of the world. It might not make you any more or less paranoid, but you will probably see and hear things in the works of humanity's greatest artists that will strike chords in you and make you feel. 

Just remember; you're not alone!Wow that's super interesting to see it presents itself often in people w neurodegenerative diseases. I have a neuromuscular disease but was much more sick as a child and I wonder if there was any connection.  There is supposedly a praying mantis alien species as opposed to the typical 'gray' alien. That's what your comment reminded me of, creepy abductions and sleep paralysis and praying mantises taking over people's bodies. That sounds absolutely horrifying. I hope your fears will fade with time. It’s called intrusive thought. I’ve got it too. My OCD was mostly until my childhood anxiety ceased a little, but the intrusive thoughts are one of the little things that stayed. I have to listen to a familiar cartoon on super low while I go to sleep so I can calm my mind a bit. Brains are so strange. Oh my god, same. I thought I was going insane because I could NOT get Cheeseburger's Coming Home out of my head. It looped for hours and hours straight. I like the song, but I was getting so sick of it and kinda angry!Yes one thing i did to make myself feel better when i felt out of control was to read about other people with ocd to remind myself that it was just my brain being an asshole. And yes it is awful. Very consuming :(Sorry to go on but with that. I’m obviously not an expert in any means, nor know very much but I’m not sure about this been anxiety. I really have no idea what it would be but looking up symptoms of anxiety they seem to be stud like sweating, tightness in chess and other physical symptoms. Issue is, everything that I have previously described in the comments above don’t have those. It’s not too much physical stuff. Sorry if I sound like I am refusing helpOf course! I've actually started writing out all of my hallucinations to maybe help someone else understand one day. My cousin is in grad school for psychology and comes to me quite often for questions about mental health, especially schizophrenia and alcoholism.The funny thing is even if the "why?" of science comes to an end with the answer being "god made it that way" there is still another question left to answer, which is, again, "why?" Why did god decide to make it like this? It's a never ending sequence of why question that we will probably never be able to answer. Even if there are higher beings that control everything, why do they do what they do? It's kinda depressing if you think too long and hard about it. All we can do is just live, I guess. [deleted]Alright, so, electricity is there because (im so sorry about this, as I am about to butcher this from memory), the electrons inside of a given material of a given conductivity, say a copper wire, has been joined with a power source in a closed loop circuit, where the charge generated by the power source is then passed on through the electrical field of the material, the field is generated by electrons moving freely around the material and spreading charges, this is called a flow of electricity.

Now, you might go, "Why are there electrons?", electrons are subatomic particles that carry a charge equivalent to one fundamental charge, with a negative sign, and like all othe subatomic particles, they are the building blocks of the building blocks of our universe, now I have no idea why they are there, but our whole universe was in a hot dense state,
Then nearly fourteen billion years ago expansion started. Wait...The Earth began to cool, the autotrophs began to drool, neanderthals developed tools, we built a wall (we built the pyramids), math, science, history, unraveling the mystery, that all started with the big bang (bang)!

Yeah, I went there. I don't even like the show that much , but hey, whatever. Also, feel free to correct me on my knowledge, I actually have my exam on this stuff tomorrow (well, today but I haven't slept yet) and can use all the help I can get!Why would there be a "Why?" question though? You speak as if things had a purpose. Things are the way they are that's all. I don't understand the need of having a "Why?"Why would you assume no one is making a decision? Why would you assume a why necessitates an intelligence?  


You cant make assumptions on what this is or why. You might be right. Maybe there is no coherent reason we exist. But to say we know enough to say there is or their isnt, thats human arrogance. Things don't always *need* to happen they just do sometimes.And you know that how, because an old book says so? How do you know it wasn't the god from some other old book? We use arabic numerals after all!Hardly! Even the planets in our own solar system are *very* far from each other. You should check out the websites that show this, pretty sobering.

For Cassini to get to Saturn, that alone took a few years, and at times it was going about 42,000mph. Light takes 8 minutes to reach us from the sun, and that's 186,000 miles/second.

Here's a [tediously accurate](http://joshworth.com/dev/pixelspace/pixelspace_solarsystem.html) example of the distances.[removed][removed][removed]I've never read the novel so I can't comment. As for myself, I guess I look at it this way. I like who I am now. But no matter what happens to me, even if I'm the picture of emotional, mental and physical health, I will be a different person in 20 years. And ten years after that. And ten years after that. And if you were to ask me then how I felt about myself, I'd probably answer similarly to how I would now.

Alzheimer's is scary. Especially, if you have an understand and awareness of what's happening. It is challenging for the individuals who suffer from it and those that love them. 

But *to me* it's a change of a different nature. I've already accepted that I can't do many of the things I used to. Things that range from trivial-- digest lactose, do the splits-- to tragic-- I'll never see my mother again. And I like to believe that I'd react to a diagnosis the way I'd react to any massive unavoidable change-- prepare to weather it as best I can, and accept that nothing stays the same forever. Not even me.‘Still Alice’ is the name of the novel. It is a fantastic read. That book, Still Alice, was incredible.  The author, Lisa Genova, is a Neuroscientist and really knows her stuff. She has written 2 other books as well-all are very well done, but Still Alice was amazing, since you don't typically get much insight from Alz patients...most info comes from caregivers.  While Still Alice was fictional, it really captured the realistic human spirit.  I still constantly recommend that book to people -it's one of my all-time favs.[deleted]I actually work with people who suffer communication disorders after stroke (my aunt has the condition as well). I see it as a glass half full sort of thing. We can always attempt to find some way for people to communicate.

My aunt for example is completely nonverbal and hemiparetic but she can comprehend speech very well and texts people on her phone. She lives alone in a community of other disabled adults that's very supportive and she often babysits her two granddaughters. If you were to ask her if she's happy she survived the stroke her answer would be "yes", unequivocally. 

Even with people who have degenerative conditions. I didn't mean to sound so disheartening earlier. My feelings are very much clouded by what I saw my mother suffer when the cancer reached her brain. She degenerated but that wasn't the same as as a condition like Alzheimer's or ALS. If you catch these early there are steps you can take to sustain communicative ability with the family for as long as possible.

And yes people change and get confused and angry sometimes. But they can still feel happiness too. I think people so often forget that.Bipolar is a mood disorder and it can be very different in everyone. It used to be called manic depression. Basically we experience depression as well as highs i.e. mania and everything in between. There are different types of bipolar - some people experience extreme highs with psychosis, lesser highs called hypomania, different levels of depression - some on the extreme end of this can experience psychosis with depression as well. There's also mixed episodes which usually combine the energy from the high with a depressive mood which is the most dangerous - we're more likely to act on suicidal thoughts in this state.

All of these episodes can range from days to years and usually rebound more severely if untreated. I'm a rapid cycler, I used to have multiple episodes a day after being misdiagnosed and prescribed prozac. Apart from medication - mood stabilisers, antipsychotics and very cautiously prescribed antidepressants - a lot of managing the illness is about lifestyle and therapy. Caffeine, stress, lack of sleep, too much sugar, etc. trigger highs and alcohol, too much sleep, not enough exercise, no social contact, stress etc. triggers lows. I also did Cognitive Behavioural Therapy as part of my treatment, I'd recommend to everyone, even if you're not 'ill'.

Not sure if that helps, but it's probably the best overview I can give without writing pages. I'm definitely a little bit higher than normal today...[removed][removed]Have you considered what purpose it serves for you? I can see how it would annoy you but at the same time it likely has some kind of function. Try to go a little easier on yourself next time you catch yourself doing it and try to analyze what that behavior is doing for you. I think this is fairly common for most people. Then again, I might just be saying that because I do it as well. Literally all the time. And I, too, will frequently catch myself and be thinking “who the fuck am I exapling this all to?... myself I guess..” and right after that, I will often continue back where I left off haha. 

I’ve just learned to live with it and let it happen. I do wonder if it is a common thing or if maybe I just think it is. honestly, from someone who doesn't do this... That exercise actually sounds really practical and useful.I think this comment is really important and I wish it were higher.If anything, a diagnosis can be a relief, or at least it was for me. It sort of gave me something substantial to explain what I was experiencing that wasn't supernatural, which helped me address and deal with it better. I studied psych too but only know this because of a family member's illness.  we weren't taught about the sex difference in school.

requested sauce: (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=8178665&query_hl=1)That cultural shift is weird too. It often hasn't lead to happiness either, just "gray" - a medicated hollownessHow exactly does a connective tissue disorder affect mental health?Well the modern consensus is generally supportive of this, it is called the dopamine hypothesis and has been supported since the 70's far as i can tell at a quick glance. It is based on these facts:

>(1) amphetamines, known dopamine receptor agonists, can produce a schizophrenia-like state in healthy adults; and (2) the discovery that the antipsychotic effect of the phenothiazines was associated with their ability to block the D 2 dopamine receptor. 

I can cite ISBN: 978-0-323-29507-9 but this can easily be found on google just as well



And here from the same book with extra citation:

>Modern neuroimaging approaches (such as positron emission tomography [PET] and single-photon emission computed tomography [SPECT]) have directly demonstrated heightened dopamine synthesis and presynaptic release in patients with schizophrenia.

Howes OD, Kambeitz J, Kim E, et al: The nature of dopamine dysfunction in schizophrenia and what this means for treatment. Arch Gen Psychiatry 2012; 69: pp. 776-786

Of course it has been shown to be more complicated, CNS is very complicated, but the dopaminergic system does play an important role, no doubt!


And to add i never said "caused", i specifically used the word "related", as the disorder is definitely multifactorial!

Edit: I guess this is better edited in - it might just as well be that the disorder causes dopaminergic system disfunction, rather than be caused, the bottom line however is that dopaminergic system seems to be a key aspect in it!Also, i never said that pharmacotherapy is the clear route to go, what i explained that the situation is such that doctors kind of need to push it, but i state in my original comment that i do believe therapy should be geared more tords symptoms than the disorder.

Also, i hate editing posts...[deleted]No problem! It was really shitty makeup I'd picked up for kicks at, like, Dollar Tree or something, and it took *forever* to wash off. (RIP pillowcase...)

Those shadow people can be goddamn trolls.I totally relate to this comment immensely. 
When I am sleep deprived and taking my ADHD meds I don't see people per se, it's like movement out of the corner of my eye that I can never actually "catch or see"

Would you mind elaborating on how you were diagnosed add /ADHD / OCD and how you finally ended up diagnosed with aspergers? That is fascinating to me and I've often wondered about someone close to me being misdiagnosed this way. I totally agree with the rest of what you said but yeah I just worry people who need to talk to a doctor will be reluctant to if we're not honest about the (small) risksSeriously his advice is beyond horribleHowever, you can't get diagnosed under DSM criteria unless it's causing impairment or distress.To be the devil's advocate, the Doctor's only know as much as you tell them. You know yourself the best. 

If it ain't broke don't fix it.

Except with airplanes, I think quality control is important with them.Same here, I recently have been working on my OCD. You do feel like you're loosing your mind, it does start to take over. My compulsions are better, but like you said getting to be manageable. I still have my days though. It's kind of frustrating the way OCD is portrayed as well in the media. Like I wish it was that simple as getting annoyed over something crooked or clean. What people don't get, for myself at least, if I don't do something a certain way, something bad will happen. And I will think about it until I do it. It's hard to carry a burden like that, constantly worrying if I don't do a compulsion or tic, I'm the reason something bad happens. Something as simple to most as locking and checking the doors a certain way( I have to jiggle the handles a certain way, and I'll go back and forth checking,, and if it's not done a certain way, It's not locked, and I'm the reason and it's my fault someone would break in)To having to wash my hands while I count to 20, or I'll get someone sick. A lot of mine have to do with being done in even numbers as well. I have a lot I do, but have gotten better at, although still daily for me, but better.Exactly the same here. My diagnosis with severe OCD at 17 was at the very least sanity-saving, and possibly life-saving. Interestingly, some of the things mentioned as schizophrenia symptoms here (the paranoia ones, mainly) are things I struggle with off and on, but in a more "OCD" way, if that makes any sense.Luckily, OCD is easily treatable, and it sounds like it was affecting your life. Schizophrenia is a stigmatizing diagnosis, and very hard to treat.  Also, if it's not affecting your ability to live normally (as OCD was for you), a diagnosis could do more harm than good.So many doctors around here.It's great to be labeled a schizophrenic.Yeah, there's a lot of things people don't realize aren't "normal" until someone tells them.

My father was born with double-vision.  This made perfect sense to him... he had two eyes, so he saw two of everything.  It wasn't until he got a basic eye exam at boot camp and asked whether the dot was inside or outside the box he had to ask "which dot?" that he finally started putting it together.

My mother and I have narcolepsy, neither of us knew until I was in my late 20's and I got worse symptoms.  Both of us would wake up at 3AM, have a bowl of cereal, each retreat to a different room, watch an hour of TV and go back to bed... 100% normal for decades.yeah, probablyParanormal? That's a weird interpretation. It was a little funny haha. I have doctors I see regularly. As the gentlemen said before, many are highly functioning members of society. We can be self-aware and still make a little joke about the voice of God. Calm down. 

Edit: typo[deleted]I'm pretty sure stuff like  "your brain releases dmt when you die" are myths. No one really knows what the hell happens regarding DMT in the brain but wow is taking a massive bong rip of it one hell of a mind blowing experience..hopefully one day we can get some in depth studies going.It depends how you see it. We know how it works : a bunch of chemical signals, synapses and networks.

We have very little idea about the specificsYou're a good parent.Yes! Not in the shower but with my fan on I can swear I can hear incredibly detailed classical music playing. I can pick out notes, instruments. It's always classical music. Another fan in another room will sound like a radio station with kind of generic intros and breaking news announcements. Another one sounds like people at a restaurant clinking cutlery while in a distant room. It's crazy how the mind works. It's all fictional and I can hear which parts are making it if I focus enough but at a blur my mind will start reshaping it into these things.>someone needs to test that theory by playing high pitched noises to their kids!  

You're five. You're sitting on the floor in your room, playing with toy cars. Suddenly, door opens. It's you father. He just stands there in the doorway, looking at you. He haven't blinked once since opening the door. Before you have a chance to call out to him, he opens his mouth and room is filled with high-pitched synthetic noise. It lasts thirty seconds, maybe a minute. Then he close his jaw, steps back maintaining an eye contact and closes the door. Many years later you confront him about that, but he denies everything.

You don't care if he's lying.

You just want the noise to stop.This is so utterly fascinating. So you can hold a conversation with him just like any real person? Is it like, socially fulfilling to talk with him? I'm imagining just having a guy around for only me to talk to who just shows up sometimes and it sounds kind of cool. But my brain doesn't do that, I can't really perceive what it would be like. super interesting, thanks for sharing

what are your thoughts on "Tulpas"?[removed]The film was less dramatic. If I remember correctly in real life he though he was working with aliens. Sorry for that incredible pain. Hope something good comes out of all of it.Which rather does away with the film's notion that he imagined a whole host of friends and employers.For all the shit Louis cl is in right now, at least the dude owned it. Unlike these other fucks who deny deny. I hope he makes it back Which made him think she was Russian spy who intercepted all his files.I think you're both confusing that scene with the one where she discovers his shack in the woods. Man, I definitely "remember" her discovering the letters as a pivotal scene in the movie, and in my memory you just see her heartbroken face. Maybe the parts left to your imagination stay with you longer because you envision them in whatever way they are most visceral to you. I'd love to rewatch this movie too[removed][removed]Just posted the other day catching up on DVR something to the effect of “I don’t know which is more terrifying, the accuracy they have in getting it right or my ability to realize such”I feel like they go back and forth with that concept intentionally, it's pretty fascinating.Yea it's a great series, it actually has a kind of horror/thriller twist to it which I totally didn't expect.¿Por qué no los dos? When I watched I thought that he was both schizophrenic *and* a mutant. Continuing to ask questions about that will lead to a few major spoilers. Just a warning.I was confused, but I watched a Wisecrack that explained it really well. I love Wisecrack too!I assumed that everyone but the protagonist was imagined after the first few eps, but then it appeared that some external characters had interactions with the world. And then didn't watch season two to have it confirmed.Mental illness is a huge part of season one, and they literally beat you over the head with it in early season two.No. No it’s not. Unless it’s done for understanding or awareness. Sorry, that wasn't  very clear was it? Basically, we test  our experiences internally for how "real" they are. Schizophrenia appears to break that testing apparatus. My dad constantly asked what felt like insane questions  in order to figure out what was real and what wasn't. Someone else said schizophrenia impairs the ability to detect discrepancies It's definitely underreported, as few would want people to think they're weird.Correct, if someone experiences this **only** as they are falling asleep this is considered Auditory Hallucinations in the vein of Exploding Head Syndrome; yes that is a real thing.yup i think there is a word for it. Used to have the sense that my mom just called me lol. I think its more common in kids.Damn how does that work? How do you dream before being asleep? 

I kinda get that too.. maybe? Can you describe what that's like?Good deal. Yea it normally happens when I’m going to sleep, but for example I’m writing this laying in bed and it’s currently happening. But I’m glad to know I’m not alone!"In a world ... where nothing is as it seems..."Yeah, I didn't think it was schizophrenia. I just wondered if that's what it's like. Because those voices are LOUD. And they echo.I've had these before. I had post-concussion syndrome and PTSD. As soon as I drifted off to sleep. Tactile and auditory hallucinations. A strange buzzing would roll up and down my body. I would hear loud banging, knocking, screaming. They were terrifying. I thought for a long time (teenage years) I might be schizo because of hypnagogic hallucinations. I have very strong ones that sometimes can come in the second I close my eyes. I have narcolepsy and experience audio hallucinations before falling asleep. Usually it's loud gunshots or someone yelling my name. This is because my sleep phases are all fucked up and out of order.  I sometimes have issues with sleep paralysis and I see a female demon in the room. Fuuuuuck that. Its terrifyingSorry if I'm digging into your issues here, but I'm glad you're so open about it. It's helping me understand those with your condition. Thank you.I got nothing else. Stay spicy my man.[removed][removed][removed]Adderall is extremely uncommon for shizophrenics since it can trigger psychosis in certain populations..I dont know what that psychiatrist was thinkingThat's just horrible. I'm sorry for your loss.It's clear. My brother took his life this past January and he was prescribed Adderall that and he was anti depressants, as and I read a study somewhere that the mix of the two can increase risk of suicide by 400%.Oh I'm almost 40 and all my amphetamine use has been recreational, fucks me up nowadays so I can't do it. One particularly bad binge left me insane for 2 weeks, and I know a guy who heard voices for 6 months after abusing the shit for over a month.

Not meth since we don't get that in Europe, our speed is amphet sulphate, which is what Americans give to kids who are no good at the completely unnatural activity of sitting still for hours at a time while someone talks at you.When and where have you seen people being misdiagnosed as schizophrenic when they were actually just taking amphetamines..........?  
O.o been treated my entire life for adhd and I've never once heard this.... Sounds pretty "Doctor Oz" to me... A lot of the time my adderall causes me not to be able to sleep even after I haven't had any in the last 24 hours, and after a day or sometimes 2 of shit non existent sleep stuff starts to get really weird. Like I'll hear conversations happening around me or like just outside my room, but then I'll go check and there was never anyone there. Or if I stare at a blank wall it will look like there is smoke rolling over it. This usually only ever happens when I take it consistently. Which I try not to do anymore because it fucking sucks and makes me all moody and depressed.I'm prescribed them as well. I don't think many realize that despite the high they get from it, for me it's the most boring drug.Two... HUNDRED milligrams a day? Isn't that unethically high to the point of serious malpractice? I thought 36mg was a pretty solid dose for most adults. 

I remember trying 36mg and, although on 9 days out of 10 it literally did nothing (for god knows why, my brain chemistry is beyond fucked), on the day that it worked, it was basically an entire day of serious amphetamine-like energy. But 200mg... the damage that must do to the heart alone. Are you sure it was 200mg? Because holy shit. Starting dose on that for a kid is 18mg.At least in women, depression and ADHD is frequently co-diagnosed. Not sure how it is for kids though. Yeeeeah, did you mean 20 (which isn't even a regular dose...) or are you just full of shit? Best of luck to you no matter what happens. Hey, I'm in the same boat: Schizophrenia runs in my family & I'm 26 too. No signs of it so far, thank godHad a friend in high school he had schizophrenia it was pretty unnoticeable most of the time but a couple of times his voices would talk to me and others around him Could be. But psychosis is common at normal doses, including in children. It’s not super common - tics and such are more common - but it definitely happens with relative frequency. Also, schizophrenia in young children is very rare. Very rare obviously doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist because of course it does. But between something common and something rare, and especially considering what seems to be the fairly mild course of illness for the OP, I would still be very suspicious of the medication. 
>True, many people suffer from comorbid conditions, or dual diagnosis. ESP involving substance abuse... 

Heh, because of the capitalization, I read "ESP" as extrasensory perception, and was like, "Where do I get me some of those pills‽"Those are called hypnogogic hallucinations and are completely normal and safe. They are sort of your dreams starting to boot up.Good to know I'm not the only one. I was thinking about this just the other day when reading, the author was describing a room in great detail, and I stopped and realised that I've never actually been able to really visualize anything like that from books, at least not in a vivid way by any means. It's all just words. Auditory-sequential learners are more likely to think in literal words.  Visual - spatial learners are more likely to see images, or just experience abstract concepts without the words. 

I'd guess you're Auditory-sequential.  Probably good at learning by listening. Ah. gotcha. Family having to take care of you and all that too and if you hurt yourself messing them all up too.Yeah, that was also when I realized I needed a different doctor. He told me it would help, but would make me sleepy at first. Didn't mention any of the bad shit that can come with it, especially if you forget to take it. I only did that a handful of times  (spending the night somewhere else and forgot to pack it, stuff like that) but good hell was I miserable the next day. I'd be sick to my stomach and unable to eat all day, have terrible headaches so bad I couldn't think, and nothing would help so I'd have to wait until bedtime to take the next one and hope I was feeling better by morning. 

I had a very severe dependence, and that's most of the reason I'm so hesitant to ever go back to any kind of medication. Bring so reliant on something like that scares me, because of how badly I was affected by it in high school. So you and I are in the same boat: if I can survive without them, I'm better off that way. My anxiety and depression have gotten pretty bad on and off over the last several  months and my mom has asked me a few times to consider medication but, like you said, I'm not a danger to myself or others so I'm going to go without it as long as I feel I'm able. Sure, feeling like this sucks, but my husband helps me with a lot of it, and at least I can feel something, and don't want to die. That's good enough for me. Or we could assume that she's an adult and talk to her like one. She's putting other people in danger and she needs to be clearly and directly informed of this. Might as well pull up YouTube while you're at it.my mother was a delightful, harmless person. she was diagnosed with schizophrenia when i was growing up, and my father woke up one morning to see her standing over him gripping a knife above him and talking to voices which (as she explained later) were telling her to kill him. she attempted suicide shortly afterwards.

risking "weight gain, lethargy, and diabetes" is absolutely fucking worth the potential to avoid loss of life. mental illness is serious. it needs to be de-stigmatized, yes, but that doesn't mean you should be promoting the idea of avoiding medication. it doesn't matter whether the schizophrenic knows right from wrong when the illness gets to the point of having more control over their body than they do.

it was extremely difficult getting her on medication and keeping her on it, but i remember what she was like when medicated: herself. i could actually see my mom during those times.>I'm unmedicated and every psychiatry and behavioral specialist wants me on meds. They say I'm like a small brush fire and it only gets worse with age.They make a choice under false promises. If they are convinced they are in a life threatening situation they will react violently violence is not rare in schizophrenic. That's completely false. One of the main components of the disease is mood lability. They can turn on you super fucking quick.Can we cut the PC bullshit? Schizophrenics are absolutely more likely to harm others than healthy people are. Depending on the study, from 10 - 23% of schizophrenics show violent tendencies. If they abuse drugs or alcohol, the probability of a schizophrenic becoming violent increases 15-fold.

If these people are to be part of society, they need to be medicated. [deleted][deleted]You know what's less constructive than what I said? Ignoring every doctor's advice and refusing medical treatment that for a mental disorder associated with unpredictable mood changes, hallucinations, and delusional behaviour. That's..what  third paragraph talks about. You have already admitted that your symptoms are sometimes triggered by external stimulus and that you HAVE engaged :you have reached for things that are not there. 

Wichita comes back to my point : yes right now you might be able to discern reality from hallucination and you may be stable, but the symptoms CAN be triggered and and when they do by the nature of your problems your ability to discern if you're Okey or not will go down too.

"Other than a few weeks ago" well, that's troubling enough. What if something else would have happened that added to that episode?

That's the problem with mental illness. When you rally really need the meds you might not be able to see it anymore. 

I'm not saying you should back to any cocktail of meds, but it's a trial and error, you should be trying to find the correct mix. 

Not every ill person is a danger, but a lot of ill people who has vivid, negative  hallucinations can just snap under the right circumstances.

You do you, but if all doctors agree is probably because they know a lot of cases like yours. You might be fine, you might always stay in equilibrium, but maybe you're one big trigger away to snapping. Hell healthy people can snap under enough stress Now watch closely, while this excerpt from barney the purple dinosaur isn't entirely up-to-date with modern paleontological theories it can still provide valuable insight.[deleted]Caaaandle !I’ve never experienced it myself but I’ve always loved reading and watching shows (back when tv was educational) about freaky stuff like that and ever since I learned about sleep paralysis I’ve been paranoid about it happening to me. Sometimes my feet are asleep when I wake up but I haven't realized it yet and when I go to get out of bed my ankles feel like soap and I face plant into my floor.Its kinda up to you. When it happens regularly, and you know its just an hallucination, you can definitely learn to have fun with it.

Yes, it can be frightening to see something in front of your eyes, or a dark entity at the foot of your bed. The first few times it happened to me, my heart would race and it would sometimes trigger panic attacks. After a while though, I made up my mind not to let my reaction escalate. Its got to the point where it doesn’t startle me quite so much and I’m like, oh, its you again.

Same thing with night paralysis. Used to scare the hell outa me. Now its a rare novelty that I actually relish when it happens.Ha, just like when you have a dream about someone I guessMy bed is in the corner of the room and it's hard to sleep anywhere else that isn't in a corner.  Whether I go to a hotel or go to to the barracks or something I will sleep like shit if I'm not in a corner.  No idea why.Dang, that sounds creepy as hell and scary.  I guess what I was wondering was if the hallucinations move and interact with you, like a real person.  Like what would a typical encounter with a hallucination be like?That's terrifyingI promise I'm not. 

There is not a shadow of doubt in my mind that psychology and neuroscience will begin to confirm the oldest wisdom, which is probably Hindu teachings and Buddhism.
There are plenty of answers to the mind in Christianity and Islam as well, and indicators of how it works.

As far as shamans go - they know how to access the abstract mind (where all the action is) using physical objects as symbols etc.

There is already a fair bit of unification with Carl Jung, Joseph Campbell with the old wisdom. 

Anybody who doubts this needs to realise that there is nothing special about this time and this generation from the perspective of understanding human nature. There is a significant disconnect between our deeper, evolved animal psyche and the modern world.

Science, and psychology, and psychiatry is quite insufficient at explaining this stuff ATM, but when it does get better, I am willing to bet my life that a lot of old wisdom is better understood. Especially shamans, that shit is no joke. I have a friend who has some type of severe schizo disorder, her brother had a worse case and committed suicide. Older relatives had been institutionalized for life. We're talking serious stuff.

She does great on meds, works an executive-level job in wealth management, has an advanced degree from Ivy-League school, exercises like a fiend, super healthy, active in volunteering, a kind and wonderful woman.

Every two years or so, her meds just stop working. Within hours to a couple of days, she's wandering the street naked, driving drunk, punching cops, and usually arrested. Her family appears, explains the situation, she is then sentenced to hospitalization, her meds adjusted, she gets stabilized. 

Then she has to deal with the legal fallout of her actions which usually involves a suspended license at minimum, mandatory drug testing, and probation.  She has been arrested so often that she is facing mandatory two years in prison if it happens again and is looking at felony charges.

Her family wanted to commit her and asked me to appear at the hearing because I witnessed her once beat her daughter and hit her in the face during an episode. Like you know those crazy homeless women who are muttering to themselves and shuffling down the street?  That's her.

I am very torn by this because she is *religious* about taking her meds, she knows she need them to function. It is not a case of her deciding to go off the medication. And while on them, she is as normal as me or you. Most people would see only a bright, successful woman.  

But I know when the meds don't work, she is capable of killing someone someday, and I believe it will happen. She will probably take down a cop, or run over someone on the street.  And a mutual friend asked me what I thought should happen, and I said I would rather her spend the rest of her life in an institution than have to explain to a parent why she was let out of jail a dozen times only to kill their kid with her car. My friend thinks I am overly harsh.

So yeah, I think we need locked facilities, or places for people like my friend to live while they are allowed to work in and be out in the general population. I would prefer it if someone was monitoring her behavior and had the power to have her committed to a hospital facility as soon as things go wrong.

Thanks for your answer - this is really interesting. Can I ask what the next step typically is for your clients once, as you day, they need a level of physical care your facility can't provide anymore?

I've also been thinking about the example that /u/cooking_question gave of his friend who is incredibly high functioning when her meds are working, but once they stop being effective is a distinct danger to herself and others. Speaking to your point about making an effort to find the least intensive model of care that will work for your clients, I'm wondering what models exist for people like this who require periods of constant, intensive supervision but are interspersed with period of independence and high performance.Wow. That must be a really interesting program to be a part of. Based on the managed alcohol aspect, I think we might live in the same city (one that fun forgot, perhaps?) as I know that we had the only one in Canada at one point. I've only had experience with acute psychiatric resources, so it's interesting to learn about the other side of the coin.This. We need mental health centers. We need doctors and medical professionals! The wait to see a psychiatrist and get prescribed the right meds for severe mental illness typically takes months. Life doesn’t slow down for the sick and many people can’t hold out or survive during that wait time. It’s tragic. I do. The invasive thoughts and whatnot are still there, but muted. Anxiety meds specifically help a LOT, I find I'm not chronically thinking people are consistently trying to gaslight me or trying to find meaning in every little comment or facial expression. Worry way less about strangers talking about me and shit. Yeah I've started to notice some repetitive phrases/ticks/thoughts. The question I have that I don't really wanna face, bc I think I know the answer is, if I wanted to make those habits stop, could I?

Right now they aren't in anyway obtrusive or problematic but if they grow and calcify, would I suddenly be unable to work myself back? For instance I mentioned this somewhere else in the thread: I always used to sing-speak little things to my cat and it became a habit. Nothing major, just stuff I would say when she climbed up on my lap or as she fell asleep there etc. But she passed recently and I find myself still saying them to myself when alone, like pretty often... Am I losing it, or do I just need a new pet? idk lolWhile in jail, the staff didn’t believe me because 2 weeks in they said there was no way to still be going through withdrawal. I relapsed when I got out of jail and eventually went to rehab. Relapsed again. Then one day just decided I was tired of not remembering. Then I went cold turkey. It was terrible.

Even to this day (it’s been 15 months) I still get weird flashback feelings. They are becoming farther and farther apart though.Without even a cursory google I must say.. Those dreams sound like a symptom to me. Suddenly changing your dreams (a hallucination, essentially..) to being very vivid seems connected to hearing a voice.That's happened to me a few times. Usually my mom's voice, but it shoots me out of sleep like a cannonball.Is it just before/just after waking up? I get very vivid dreams sometimes in the morning immediately before waking up; sometimes auditory hallucinations of somebody calling my name, but that's rare and not very vivid (been a while in fact, not since I was young.)Here’s some more info if you’re curious :)

The noises that you hear just before falling asleep or just after waking up are like a pre-dream state. Sometimes the voices I hear before I fall asleep I recognize as the people I’ve talked to throughout the day, where as sometimes it’s a voice I don’t recognize. These sounds you hear don’t have to be just voices. They could be loud noises(exploding head syndrome) or they could be sounds like a doorbell or dogs barking. 

Even though I do experience this often, I definitely get caught off-guard sometimes by the noises I hear. Look into hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations. They are fairly common, more so if you suffer from other sleep disorders such as sleep paralysis and narcolepsy. I get this when falling asleep sometimes, brains are weird. I hope so!Damn I didn't know you could take something for sleep paralysis. I get it rarely but it freaks me out when I do. It’s not that bad. Sorta like an older relative chuckling at you, like when you were a little kid and did something cute and dumb.Maybe we're swapping. Give my dreams back, dude.Closest experience would probably be something while under psychedelics. I've had experiences where I'm 99% aware I was under the influence of a substance but that didn't make what I saw seem any less real. It's one of those things that's hard to explain because how different it is.Your life must be pretty pathetic. Sorry about that. Hope you turn things around for yourself.Calling something factually incorrect isn't crying, child. Why are you like that? Everything you've said in this thread has moved me to tears. I wish you peace and joy, and the best of luck in your medical career. Humanity is lucky to have you.We get it. Go away.Honestly what even is wrong with you.Cool. Good luck. Sorry your other project didn't work out Weird. My “sleep walking” symptoms dissipated after puberty. 

How is your vitamin B? Mine is low. 
I too am really inconsistent with taking supplements. Reading this just validated these same symptoms I've been experiencing and thinking I was nuts or exaggerating it. My hands and feet do the same thing, only once the blood circulates it's more like they burn. 
Thanks for sharing. That's REALLY interesting.  Thank you for sharing!

I don't care how I look when walking, but I just don't want to roll my ankles anymore! :(Weed and how it interacts with the brain is close to that of schizophrenia (both affect the cannabinoid system) so recently theres been some studies looking at it. Majority of people quit smoking weed because of the anxieties that it gives them, also schizophrenic symptoms have been tied closely with frequent use. I think the thc makes the disease progress worse but the cannabidiol (cbd) can help slow its progression.Thanks for the response dude really helped 
I just found this after googling what symptoms were. I'm super confused as I don't know what counts as a symptom and what doesn't. As it seems to be much more in depth than what's described on medical sites.  I'm commenting on this thread in particular because someone mentioned walking and moving. I walked on my tip toes a lot as a child and still occasionally find myself doing it but rarely now. I've also always had the bent arms despite not being on any anti psychotics. I get teased for it, not meanly, sometimes about why I'm just sitting or standing there with dinosaur arms. I don't do it all the time but don't even realize when I am. I also stand awkwardly, I have to actually put work into standing normally. Hard to explain but I stand with one leg crossed over the other. People say it looks uncomfortable but I'm actually very comfortable. I always have to sit with my legs tucked up, anything else feels weird and uncomfortable. And I really only walk weird out in public or around lots of people. I've always been severely clumsy and space out a lot. I've noticed that I walk and sometimes move really slowly, arms in front of me, as in slightly bent one hand holding onto my other wrist, and feel like I'm stiff mainly when anxiety hits in public. Is any of this normal? I'm asking now because I was asked at a psychiatrist if I "made awkward movements" I said no, but now this has me thinking. I couldn't be diagnosed but was told she's "never seen anything like it". Apparently I have extremely low cognitive function in some areas, and extremely high, beyond normal functioning in others. Oh man this was amazing thank you seriouslyThing is, I have no idea how I came up with that. This was pre-internet with only basic cable, nobody really into scary movies that I knew, just very kid friendly Disney kind of television watching at that age. No scary stories from older siblings, nothing. I didn't have any close friends at that age, either, mainly played on my own or with my sister. The scariest thing I saw was The Brave Little Toaster and Wizard of Oz, lol.

For a young brain to come up with that on its own with no context was frankly what made it so terrifying. That's funny you mention anxiety. I used to have pretty bad anxiety when I was 18/19 and over the years it's gotten better and better. I still get it occasionally (mainly having to do with emails - don't ask), but I feel like I've been able to "beat it." The whole OCD thing started within the last four years, and I think that's actually when a lot of my anxiety started to go away...  This happens to me a lot. Probably like 4 or 5 days a week. It's beyond fucking annoying. I try to listen to classical music at night because if I listen to anything lyrical I will, without a doubt, wake up with it in my head. UGHNo need to apologise :) I'm not a medical professional so can't really help more than that but it's always better to get assessed to be safe, especially if you have symptoms that are getting worse. 

I recently started going to a psychiatrist and it's been really helpful - I got diagnosed with ADHD and possible anxiety but have different symptoms to yours. With treatment it's been a lot better so I'd definitely recommend it!You can just be humble and in awe of everything that is, its hard to believe that we humans even understand anything, i mean who are we? Just some miserable small beings on a random planet in a random solar system in a random galaxy of a random galaxy-cluser of countdless galaxy-clusters.

We are *so* small. Who are we to be pridefull in any way.Mocking me doesnt help.

Stop thinking, that just because im christian i have to be stupid, because that is a stupid assumption. I have thought things through, i have studied stuff and i have come to the conclusion that there has to be a god. I fully accept your point of view, you can believe whatever you want, but mocking anyone for anything just brings more division into the world and kindles fire more.So from the standpoint of everything i have learned everything seems alright :)Thats how you percieve life and what you live like, but thats not the case for everyone.

For Christians, Muslims, Hindus and so on there is an answer to the why, even if you dont believe that there even is a why.

I for myself want to know why im here, why do i exist, what do i live for and so on. You can answer those questions biologically but that is not enough of an answer to me.I actually believe the opposite, i believe there is a reason for everything, but i didnt want to promote my standpoint on this, i just wanted to say that the bible and religion in generall answer the why and not the what.

And yes, you cant say for sure anything is anything until we know everything, because anything could twist our view of anything, but you could believe in something, not in a way that you think it might or might not be, but in a way that you base your decisions of life on that what you believe in and thats what i choose to do.Yes, i didnt disagree with you, i just said that thats what the bible answers.I believed in the book, because i believe in god, not the other way around. Now i believe in both because of both, but it started with god. I visited a  church and had the moment of my life meeting my creator for the first time. Since then i believe in the bible. People might say im prideful for saying that, but i cant pretend to not have experienced what i have experienced and experience everyday.Our solar system is a spec to the universe? I still don't see your point sorry[removed]That's incredible that you are able to make peace with time like that. It's really admirable. I hope I can gain that kind of perspective as I become older. I'm sorry for the loss of your mother. 💜No, *Go Ask Alice* is the fictional diary of a teenage girl who becomes addicted to drugs and eventually is found dead by her parents. It's a good book but not the same one. I'm sorry I don't recall the title of the book I'm talking about. If I do I'll edit my comment. [removed]My internal thought are 90% monologues. When I'm alone, I even talk out loud. I also rehearse discussions with people. I read somewhere talking to oneself is a sign of loneliness. It used to be very common back in the days of the old countryside, but in our current civilisation, everyone is living on top of each others, so talking to oneself has become weird.

But in my case, it also helps me organising my thoughts.It frustrates me because they are my own thoughts and I know the reasons behind them or what I meant. I feel there is no reason to expand on what I already know.Thanks! Much appreciated!In my time the consensus was that being depressed in your teenage years was a normal developmental phase, and it wasn't treated unless it persisted or paralysed someone's life. Surely some people didn't receive the intervention they needed, but also there were many people who literally grew out of it and did not enter adulthood with a mental health diagnosis. Of course there is nothing wrong with such diagnosis, but I can't help thinking young people are being overdiagnosed today and not given a space to go through the adolescence pains without being somehow labelled. I am not sure it is extremely empowering to start thinking of yourself as mentally ill just because you suddenly discover life is not always happy. Well any disorder can trigger a stressor to make someone depressed.

In this case I don't think the OP was saying his syndrome was a mental health disorder, but instead was saying that culture effects the treatment you will receive for your disorder.Your "physical" health greatly affects your mental health. Anything associated with chronic pain or a decrease in quality of life can really mess with your emotions and mental health. 

Also. Mental health is still a physical health issue. So, of course, one physical health issue could affect another. In my case it doesn't, and that's what I said in my post - I was drawing parallels between mental health and other disorders.
But for some people, yeah, the whole nervous system is a bit out of whack due to the faulty tissue; also living with a chronic condition in itself can cause problems. I'm actually working on a series of worksheets that are designed to do that: outline my most common altered states and how I would be best helped during that time. One of the issues is that there's not only one way of feeling bad. 

There's dissociation, then there's paranoia, then there's anxiety, then there's delusional, then there's psychotic, then there's empty, then there's manic, then there's depression. The things that are helpful during a dissociative phase are not the same as the things that help during a delusion. I say 'psychotic break' to help simplify it for people who are just starting to learn about schizophrenia, but from my perspective on the inside, it's much more nuanced.

Also, even within the same type of episode, it's not always the same. For example, during one delusional episode, I might have a Capgras delusion (which *really* fucks up interpersonal communication). The next time, I might have a delusion that my house is floating in space and unattached to the Earth. I can't predict what my next delusion will be about, so I can't give a firm answer on how to handle it.Well after talking to my mom because I was too young to remember most of it I found out that my first diagnosis was actually schizophrenia at about 7, I loved animals and the animorphs books at the time and the psychiatrist I saw after what is now obviously a meltdown event and she didn't believe that I was capable of reading them or understanding the things I was talking about because I was strongly opinionated about animal conservation and she thought that I believed what I was reading was real.

The medications I was put on at the time is what brought on the hallucinations.

Fast forward a year and I have a new psychiatrist because she retired, this one decides that I'm bipolar and ODD (opposition defiant disorder) and he halves the dosage of the original medication and adds a mood stabilizer.  I don't remember the specifics but over the next couple years I get bounced to a couple other doctors with little success with the diagnosis changing each time, this is the period I get the ADHD and OCD labels that I was labeled with for a few years. 

Then around 13 to 15 I started seeing a doctor who was highly regarded in the area we actually had quite a bit of success with him for a while he couldn't figure out exactly what it was but he listened to what we were saying and actually worked WITH us instead of just insisting he was right and not budging.

Around this same time we went on vacation with some family, this relative was the head of the special needs program for the school district where they worked and had experience with autistic kids, and after dealing with me during this vacation they recommend I get tested for it.

We go back home and when we see my psychiatrist the next time we bring up her suggestion and he sets up the appointment.

After all that I get the Asperger's diagnosis, the funny thing is that that psychiatrist said that if it weren't for all the previous diagnosis leading him the wrong way that autism spectrum would have been one of his first thoughts.

On of the reasons that my diagnosis kept changing though is that the meds never reacted the way they should have, for example one I took that causes most people to lose their appetite caused me to have an insatiable hunger. I doubled my weight the year I was on it.

If you have any other questions I'd be glad to talk about it when I'm at a computer but this was a lot to type on a phoneI don't get why this comment is getting downvoted. If a condition is not causing impairment or distress then according to the DSM it is not a disorder and therefore need not require intervention. 

The drugs prescribed in the psych unit I rotated through in med school have serious side effects that should be accounted for as well as the risk of relapse due to a very low rate of medication adherence among schizophrenics. 

Lastly, this needs to be said: What if Jesus/Moses/Mohammad were schizophrenics? Exiled as a lunatic or accepted as a prophet. Imagine how the world could have been. Mental illnesses aren't something that should be ignored. They tend to get worse if they are not treated.I think the point of becoming a doctor is that THEY know best in matters of health  
If It ain't broke don't fix It, alright, but those kind of allucinations are considered as something broken, so yeah, fix it before It gets worse"if it may have been breathed on or looked at weird, call in the necessary shop to have them test it and tell you to replace it"
I enjoy working on the C17 and I think our quality control measures work pretty well! YES! It was always that fear of causing something bad to happen if you didn’t follow through with your compulsions! Thankfully my OCD seems to only come in episodes (my therapist thinks I may even just have anxiety with OCD tendencies most of the time), but my boyfriend has Pure OCD and it is SO difficult for him. I wish you the best! It does get better with time and professional help :)Makes total sense! I was thinking the same! Thankfully my OCD isn’t that bad anymore (as I said in my comment up above), but my boyfriend’s pure OCD is so bad, more like what you’re describing. I think a lot of OCD can even be like paranoia-lite hah. Because it’s not like being suspicious that something’s going to happen you’re just SUPER anxious and panicked that it will if you don’t follow your compulsions... with a twinge of paranoia for fun!I totally get what you mean. I can make myself sick to my stomach with worry sometimes about things, and things that really aren't even going to happen, or out of my control. My therapist helped me realize a lot of my compulsions and when I do worry, is because I am trying to take control of what I can, if that makes sense. And I don't trust myself. That's what I've been working on trusting myself. And when I do get frustrated with my compulsions, to be kind to myself and not angry. I have a lot of confusingly badly diagnosed sleep issues and what you've just described is my mother and I. What type of narcolepsy is that? Not that we necessarily have it but oh man, any leads would be great.That’s not narcolepsy though... “Narcolepsy causes sudden attacks of sleep. Sudden loss of muscle tone and hallucinations might occur.”

Fun fact. Someone can be brilliant and have no idea what they're talking about. [deleted][deleted]We have lots of information about the specifics. I don't know why people propogate this BS. There's plenty of laymen books to read about the fine details of how the brain works. Yes this happens to me too! I always think I hear music when I'm falling asleep with my fan on. he also didn't have that many visuals hallucinations.

but auditory hallucinations aren't quite as cinematic.If we've learned anything from Stranger Things it's that [if you water down the truth the rest of the world is more inclined to believe you](/s "if you water down the truth the rest of the world is more willing to believe you")... maybe Nash was really on to something eh?Aye.  The shack with walls covered in notes. I only watched that scene. Someone else said we were probably both remembering a different scene where she finds a bunch of his stuff in a cabin so not sure.[removed][removed]Absolutely, it's well cast all around.  I enjoyed Unforgotten.

Not the same cast, but in a somewhat similar, though darker, vein is Happy Valley as well.Thank you for your post about your post Hi. I'm a performer from the first season.

Even while filming the sixth episode, or around there, the first assistant director told me, that he and the other crew members still didn't know what was going on with the movie. In other words, the director and writer kept it complex intentionally.That's where I landed- him with a British, almost Patrick Stewart accent, was his schizophrenia manifesting. Before, his actions were almost prodromal, or early signs suggesting an eventual diagnosis. I think he will have to cope with alternate personalities as well as his powers going forward.Exploding Head Syndrome is an appropriate name for how it affects me. I always hear a large crash or popping sound that jolts me back awake.

Doesn't happen very often, most of the time I think it's while I'm "drifting" off to sleep unintentionally. It reminds me of falling asleep in class and jumping awake.I hate exploding head syndrome. It's very jarring. If I'm fatigued I get them even if I'm not trying to fall asleep. I would guess your brain is saying "hey fucker go to bed". https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnagogia

More colloquially known as 'sleep hallucinations'It's mostly images and sounds in my mind the same way you would remember a dream except it's "live" as I'm laying there. I am in that state right before you fall asleep where you know you are about to be out but are still aware of being awake. They aren't as defined as regular dreams. If I open my eyes I only have a vague sense of them, so they aren't visual hallucinations. Most of the time it's shapes of people. I go right into the dream state a lot of the time. I can have a fully realized dream even if I've only been asleep for 5 minutes. Ah, gotcha. Sorry for the misunderstanding :)In another comment thread, someone said that the activity you're having when you're sleeping, those with schizophrenia have even when they're awake. So it's likely a similar experience, although not always loud. I had a pretty bad concussion when I was a kid and now the voices and hallucinations I had for a while make a lot more sense after researching that syndrome right now. Thanks for the inadvertent prompt there. Damn that's fucked. Did the PTSD contribute to the hallucinations in any way?That's when mine always started too, right while drifting off. No problem!We never bothered looking into it much even though me and my sister firmly believe it triggered his symptoms to get really bad again. We didn't want to push our parents to look into it any further either. I think it would break their heart even more to know it was a medicine he shouldn't have ever been prescribed that pushed him to do it.  
Thank you. I miss him a lot. Even in the worst of his disease he was always so kind. In the peak of it he was homeless bc he wouldn't let us get him help bc he didn't think he needed it. When he finally agreed to it he moved back into our parents. It was around Christmas time and he had very little money but he bought us all gifts with what he had from a little gift shop by us. I still have the bracelet he got me. Okay, yes! I did not want to assume you were a chronic abuser lol. But psychosis from stimulants is rare unless taken at high doses or chronically. But, I am American and my son takes amphetamine sulphates. He is VERY hyper active and when I say very I mean extremely. His first week of school I didn’t have the med form filled out yet so he couldn’t take it. I got a call from the school one day telling me that he was in trouble for the day because he was “doing flips in the classroom “ so I asked him to show me. He was doing legit flips in the room while the kids were working and he said “I cannot help it, my brain tells me I need to keep going and do flips”.  I was totally against meds for years but decided once he got older and it’s changed his production level drastically. I just worry about what’s to come later in life! Ahh amphetamine psychosis. I used to get texts and calls on my phone constantly from random numbers telling me that they were outside of my house. I knew it wasn't real but I needed to check every time.This is not “dr oz” this is actually really common for people who abuse amphetamines and take amphetamines at high dosages. Check out some medical journals, or even some of these comments that will show you how many people experience schizophrenia like symptoms when taking amphetamines. Just because you haven’t, doesn’t mean no one has. My son takes amphetamines, he is also monitored by a psychiatrist (I assume you are as well). This is why there are specialists who treat this, bc you must be monitored. Chronic abusers who begin to hear voices are not checking in with their local dealer to report any changes in symptoms...but don’t ask me ..Yes, i started on 36 when i was 18 years old, and for some reason it had almost no effect on me. So they bumped me up to two a day. Couple months later im on like 4 a day and my mum is concerned and she said to me "bloody hell isn't 4 a day a bit much?", the doctor replied "oh no he should be fine!" fast forward to early 2014 i'm at almost 200mg and it was reaaaaally fucking me up, i tapered myself off them and refuse to take medication for my ADHDYes, although i was diagnosed in 2013 when i was 18, and took myself off them a year laterNot full of shit at all, just very misguided and stupid.Thank you.For sure. Either way the medication likely contributed to something which resulted in his symptoms. Given it was so long ago, we have much more “cleaner” stimulants and I think professionals (psychiatrists) have much more training in this area now, hopefully! Lol when you find them let me know!! It's called aphantasia. When I learned about it, so many things suddenly made sense. My literary preferences were one of them. I never understood why people enjoyed those overly descriptive books where they go into exquisite detail about colors or patterns. It was all so boring until I realized that people could actually conjure that image up and that each line added actual useful information. To me it's a waste of a paragraph. 
Oh man. Should've known you were a troll. Bye.The problem of that once you cross the line is and become a dangerous to yourself or others you might not be able to recognized it. 

If your condition gets worse your ability to realize how is affecting you will too. Just because you had shit doctors and hace not found the right medicine is not reason you to give up. 

You might be a time bomb, it's a real possibility 

 I'm sorry you went through that. I only made it 3 days before   I told my doctor I wasn't taking that. That's when she literally admitted the ends justify the means, hey at least you're not manic! I wasn't even awake to be anything lol. The sheer amount of pills given, with the air of being talked at left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I'm depressed at the moment, due to a personal tragedy. But I have therapy twice a week, and a great support system. I'm not going back to meds, not unless I'm really in a bad place. I'm doing fine, contrary to what everyone screaming at me in the comments wants to think. Pm me any time you'd like, trust me I can commiserate. 100% they are right.Free lobotomies for all?

Because that's pretty much what the wrong meds do, and a whole lot of people are fine with a drooling husk rather than fiddle with dosages for years...My bad lol wrong chain. Sometimes I think I'm the only one who can't follow the little grey lines. 

There are ways to manage schizophrenia without meds, but only kinda sorta and there are no guarantees... Meds are really the way to go, but saying that they're going to kill or hurt someone just because they're not on meds is pretty insulting, you know, unless you know 100% they have a history of serious aggression or of violenceDon't get me wrong, I agree with your sentiment. I genuinely do hope that OP will go to a doctor and find a medication that works for them. It's scary and tough, nevertheless what I meant is that there are many people here in this thread that also have schizophrenia, take their medication and lead very normal and healthy lives. But also have to face this kind of sentiment all the time it's not a competition for shitty things to sayI admitted in response to the question, I do not walk around entertaining my delusions. My recent episode was triggered by a tragedy, and I'm fine. I let my therapist know to be on standby should I decide to pull out the big guns. That is and will remain my treatment plan, in response to how would I deal with "more stress" if it got worse. 

What I should be is healthy in mind and in spirit. I'll take a hard pass on going back to being a walking vegetable. That's my last resort. I write, read, do therapy, spend time with family. You're entitled to your opinion and I'm entitled to mine, and I understand your concern, but I'm good. Well, my psychosis was due to amphetamine use, so I knew right away what was happening, why it was happening, and knew exactly how to make it stop happening. If you are hallucinating with a normal brainstate, speaking to a doctor could definitely helpThat's a different kind of sleep paralysis.I do this too! I’m not alone lol.For me, they just kinda stand there and stare. Maybe take one or two shuffly steps but that’s it. Seems like the original OP gets far moreHow, exactly, is "shamanism" (a vague term) better than modern science at understanding and treating conditions like schizophrenia? Technically, these places exist. Halfway homes, outpatient programs, they're out there. I worked an outpatient rec therapy program at a psychiatric hospital here in Canada and most of my clients were either in halfway houses or living in the community and attending various programming related to their mental health.

Best of luck to your friend. Mental health is a journey, not a destination. It's unfortunate that she's having health and legal troubles but there are consequences for our actions. Hopefully the legal result takes into account her illness.The short answer is it depends. Types of physical illness that seem to be common and are beyond the scope of our care often include advanced kidney or liver disease, congestive heart failures, and complicated cancers. 

 For the physically ill client typical placement will be in a nursing home.  Up until a few years ago the state had a couple of specialized geriatric psych hospitals/homes where the aging population could be placed. But budget cuts. We really have to applaud our Social Workers for finding placement for these clients, as they may have to apply or interview at up to a dozen facilities before they find one that is able to take the client.  Sadly, by the time we get these clients into nursing home care it will then be time for the nursing home to start finding palliative or hospice care if they aren't really equipped to provide those services. 




Part two of your question; about people like Cooking's friend.
Once again the answer is it depends, but there are more options in this case. Now my experience is a little tainted because nearly all of the clients that are placed in the facility I work for have been judicially committed.  Here that means they are a danger to themselves/others or are unable to provide for basic living needs and protect themselves against harm/ safely survive. 

I'll try to keep this from getting convoluted, but since there are so many factors at play it may get messy.  Ideally, it is hoped that the patient can be released back into the care of family.  They may have parents or children that are willing to supervise and care for them.  For some of our clients this can be the case, but over time parents age and are unable to provide the level of support needed.  As the story told the continuous need for care begins the wear on the family or the volatile nature or the illness puts the life of the caregivers at to much risk for them to be comfortable to provide the level of support needed.  Often the parents will also have mental health issues, have been abusive, absent, or otherwise unfit to support.  There are continuing care organizations that provide outpatient support even when released to family.  These groups frequently assist in administering long acting anti-psychotic medications and social support networks.  

A second option is a less restrictive behavioral health hospital.  It's not quite a group home, but it provides intensive behavioral and mental health support without being a locked facility. 

A group home is typically the support system that most of our type of client is released to.  Here they learn to better manage the activities of daily living, but with structured guidance from people with at least a little training and a desire to help.  They still have access to the support network of doctors, psychiatrists, and social and case workers.  This is the best option for a lot of people.  They still get lots of supervision and support, but have the independence to have jobs and a semblance of a "normal" life. 

But in reality mental health care for so many is a revolving door.  They get treatment are are stable for a while, get released and do well for a while and then relapse due to any number of causes.  

Almost as an aside,  I really do like working for the facility I work for.  We are a locked facility, but at least its not jail and our higher functioning clients do get to participate in community and public activities.  The staff really does care and we aren't going to mistreat our clients in anyway.  I spend just as much time with the clients as I do with my own family.  We do want to see them get better and have a chance at more independent living. 

There are a lot of finer details that I'm omitting or just not that familiar with, but I hope that gives you an idea of the complexity of the situation. 


    No, try the one known for donut shops haha. I've been in a dead end, under the table job for the last year or two, and I'm so convinced I'm blackballed from a future. I'm scared to leave my little zone and be there weirdo at a new job. 


I'm getting pushed out next week, so I guess we'll see where I end up. I have no idea. I think when it becomes a problem is when you can't stop it. For me, it's just something I can no longer control when I have a bad image in my head. It just...comes out, in a series of three. "Hitler Hitler Hitler" or "I wanna DIE I wanna DIE I wanna DIE" or a bunch of other things I won't repeat on Reddit. I started trying to turn it into something more positive, but now it just sounds silly. "I wanna DYE my hair red!"

Is it impacting your life though? All I'm saying is, if it's a detriment to your life: Seek a remedy.I am so sorry. That is a nightmare. They’ve known about these problems for a long time. It’s messed up that a doctor would be irresponsible enough to just give a standing prescription these days. Holy shit, I would really be scared of I heard a dead family member talking to me every morning... I’ll do that! Thank you. 

Schizophrenia runs in my family, and I have a good amount of mental issues... I think I just get paranoid and this is a newer thing ah, I should clarify. I don't take meds specific to sleep paralysis. I take an SNRI and an antipsychotic. but it messes with my brain chemistry enough that a helpful side effect has been no more sleep paralysis. the moment i miss one dose, it happens again though.My mum wants my brother to stop walking on his toes so he won’t going through shoes so quickly. But he’s not motivated enough to try change, so it hasn’t made a difference. Hopefully you can get the hang of it and it helps your ankles. Just focus on swinging your foot out a bit more when you walk and making first contact with your heel, rolling along the sole of you foot. Good luckYea there is drug induced psychosis, but if I'm remembering correctly that isn't a long term effect like schizophrenia, but I may be wrong.You're welcome. Any time you have more questions send them and I'll try and get to them as quick as I can.Can you speak to a different psychologist/psychiatrist? Tell them about the odd movements and see what they say.Any time hun :) PM me if you need someone to chat to!OCD actions are typically a way to bring you down from anxiety. As a kid I had poor vision and was terrified of the dark. I used to have to look under everything in my room in a certain order, then I’d say my prayers. If I messed up, I’d have to start over, because otherwise something bad would obviously happen. I had a lot of other stuff too. 

It’s possible that your OCD is what has relieved your anxiety a bit. Sometimes it’s more about balance. OCD isn’t always terrible. It’s when it starts negatively effecting your life that you may need intervention. I know putting on my right shoe second won’t hurt me, but I won’t do it. But I’m also aware this is completely harmless. I believe the consciousness that is "us" expands much farther than just earth."God did it" just seems like the simple way out to a universe that is incredibly complex and hard to understand. Just because we can't fathom or fully understand it, people assume it has to be a higher power. As long as your faith doesn't effect me, I'm cool with you believing in Jesus. There doesn't *have* to be a God though, why do you feel that way? I'm agnostic for what it is worth. I haven't seen convincing evidence either way, so at the moment, "I don't know if there is or is not a God". I'm surprised any scientist is an atheist; that isn't very scientific at all. Okay. There will eventually be a point where one of you is right, be it death when you find out (or don't) if you believe that. I personally am against the Bible purely because of it's narrow views, I have studied many religions not just "stuff" and have come to the the conclusion that there is room for a god or many, and science. However I do not believe in the Christian ideology because of the many many flaws that come along with it. [deleted]What if you aren't here for a specific reason? What if we are just accidents created by organic chemicals mixing which eventually after billions of years lead to evolution and thus us?I dont really buy that. If religion aims to explain why, it does a poor job. It doesnt reconcile something and nothing. It doesnt sufficiently explain causes and motivation of creation.


Ie. God just existed and he decided to make stuff out of boredom? 


I always thought religion was a good placeholder for knowledge and for law and order until our reason precluded the need to have an answer for everything.  When existentialism no longer led to madness.  To put faith in something so garish and illogical serves no real purpose but to ease a simple mind. Atheists are used to being called "arrogant" on account of leaning on science, but we're not the ones claiming a personal relationship with a creator of an entire universe. We're just learning as we go along.

No idea why other christians would call your experience "prideful" since they claim the same thing as you.You ask how I know that the universe is so empty. I just provided examples of the planets closest to us, and how vastly empty our own solar system is.

We have spacecraft that have ventured well out of our solar system, and camera like Kepler discovering potentially-habitable planets well outside of our reach- too far to ever physically explore or even contact (at least by today's standards.) 

The amount of emptiness is more than we can even comprehend. Yet you say it's not?Thank you. And I don't know your age, but I'm only 26! Stop trying to make me feel old.That scene haunted me as well. Still Alice was made into an excellent movie, and Julianne Moore received the best actress award for her portrayal. Thank you. I deleted my comment because I read the wiki and it's definitely not the one you're talking about.ah, I could how that can be frustrating and exhausting.I think you have it pinned. People often are not allowed to be "normal" any more, whatever that is.Yes, that's what cross-cultural psychiatry does.
Nothing happens in a void, everything - even diseases (mental or not) happens in a social, cultural and political context, and it makes a huge difference to the way the are seen, treated and experienced.Will these worksheets be something that you share with others online? I know they would be tailored to you and your altered states but I could see them potentially helping others or allowing people to realize that they themselves may be experiencing some issues. This may sound weird but, learning to cope/help a person through the situations you've described takes a lot of hands on training, just like a Service animal would. The person would have to have a lot of patience, love, and tolerance AND the right personality. They could be 100% for wanting to help you but severely lacking knowledge so just be careful you don't (become too jaded and) brush off the right person just because they lack the know how. Thank you SO much for taking the time to write that out and respond. It is so so helpful! 
I am sorry you had to deal with all those changes and  finally found a doctor who listened to you. 

The part about medications not working as prescribed is familiar to me, and is probably one of the most interesting parts. 

I truly appreciate you sharing this with me. I will think about it all for awhile and maybe come back with more questions. But just even this response has been helpful. Best of luck to you. It's getting down voted because it's encouraging people to not seek help since it isn't bad enough to be labeled schizophrenia.  It relies on the assumption that the person will recognize when it starts to affect a person's day to day life. 

I prefer to think of schizophrenia like carbon monoxide poisoning.  People think they will be alert enough to stop it if it gets a hold of them, they likely won't.  I wasn't able to detect the slide into schizophrenia until it was too late and my family had to intervene.  Schizophrenia is degenerative, it only gets worse the longer it goes unchecked.  Age plays a factor.  If they are early 20s and having regular hallucinations it's something to casually keep an eye on medically as it could be premorbid schizophrenia.  Schizophrenia kicks in around mid to late 20s.  That's a relatively short window for preventative measures. Sigh..the world would have been a much better place if they were exiled as lunatics. I'm not sure why there is such a connection between the euphoria of religion and mental illness.. but folks have been known to drown their children in the bathtub because God told them to.  

Kudos to the folks who struggle with this and yet get up every day and make the best of your world. I am deeply in awe of your strength and determination. 

Here, here. My OCD is anxiety-based, too, and since I'm always anxious (yay anxiety disorder along with a slew of other mental health issues like being bipolar and autistic), it's a constant thing. I've had to channel it into "healthier" things, like staying on strict schedules for myself and my pets or walking through drills to soothe myself in somewhat harmless ways -- not all harmless, admittedly, but my therapist and psychiatrist and I are working on it. It helps calm me down, because animals thrive on schedules, and my autism relies heavily on that. People always joke, "Life is hectic!" and I can pretty much deadpan, "Not mine. I'd go nuts if it were." I try to make light of it, because if I didn't, I'd cry lol ...not that I haven't done that, either, though.Thank you! I have been seeing a therapist as well, and she has given me lots of coping methods to help. I was diagnosed with OCD almost a year ago, and also get anxiety attacks(those have luckily subsided, and become fewer in between,also with the help of prescription). Anxiety is a symptom of OCD, or the other way around I forget. But I wish you both luck as well! It was nice to hear someone else can relate!💜The waking up in the middle of the night is a much lesser known symptom... The most well-known is the sleepiness.  The sleepiness is really because you never get a full night's sleep.

So basically with narcolepsy you're chronically sleep deprived, largely from not sleeping deeply enough at night.  I can't speak for everyone, but I typically wake up around 3AM if I'm not taking anything to keep me asleep.  And when I wake up I can't fall back asleep unless I physically get up and do something for an hour.

Many times I've tried to just roll over and go back to sleep, only to find myself still awake at 6AM.
That's more like sleepwalking. Narcolepsy is when you have what are called 'sleep attacks', where you fall asleep suddenly and unpredictably.Actually it is... The sudden attacks of sleep are due to chronic sleep deprivation.

Additionally, the region of the brain that's supposed to regulate sleep is basically killed off in an autoimmune disorder, so while it puts you out when it's not supposed to, it'll also wake you up when it's not supposed to.  There's nothing ensuring you're awake when you should be, or asleep either.

https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Narcolepsy-Fact-Sheet
>Many individuals with narcolepsy also experience uneven and interrupted sleep that can involve waking up frequently during the night.    

Believe me dude, I've had this 10+ years and I've had 2 all-night sleep studies to verify it... I really wish I didn't have it.How would they?http://jonlieffmd.com/blog/the-limits-of-current-neuroscience

Laymen books and pop science articles grossly overestimated current state of knowledge. I know first had it happens with physics, and I suspect it's no different with neuroscience

We know a lot about individual pathways, connections and functioning, but complexity arises when you look at the the whole system. It has a lot of similarities with matter physics and statistical physics, where we (suspect) we know almost all there is to know classical mechanics and yet complexity gives rises to emergent phenomena where we are at the infancy of the field spoiler tag didn't quite work out :/[removed][removed][removed][removed]This is a great one as well.Oh, that's freaking awesome! 

Were you one of the dancers in[ this scene?](https://youtu.be/tX1wOVE5k9M?t=25)

My other 2 favorite scenes from Legion are [Lenny's Dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AfE3TDJwHs) and the Chalkboard animation. Legion surpassed my expectations. So well done!It's interesting that you say that about Patrick Stewart. The lead character is supposed to be the bastard child of Dr. X.Wow, TIL.  I've been experiencing mild hypnagogic hallucinations most of my adult life without every having a name for it.  Usually, for me, it takes the form of something I know I need to get out of bed to investigate, like knocking on the door or the dog barking to be let out or somebody calling my name.

I've always attributed those falling-asleep-hallucinations to the fact that I'm a natural lucid dreamer, but apparently it's unrelated.  Good to know.This explains a lot about my experiences. I frequently get into a state of hypnogogia and the hypnic jerk is common for me too.It definitely contributed to the sleep deprivation which is thought to be a cause of hypnagogic hallucinations. Goddamnit that's beautiful, what a guy. It's about a month and ten days early but Merry Christmas to you and your family <3It’s a trade off. Had my parents not gotten me diagnosed and medicated when I was young, I probably would have ended up failing out of school. It’s not just focusing that medication helps, it’s being able to control the urge to act on impulse (which often got me in much more trouble than not doing schoolwork)


Sadly, “growing out of it” isn’t a thing for everyone; I’m nearly 30 and still depend on meds to work (software developer), but aside from insomnia (which I attribute to my mothers genes) I never developed any mental conditions. Either way, I think the life it enabled me to have was well worth any potential risk.


Thanks for being a good parent and getting your son the help he needed, he’ll thank you one day. Also, meds help but don’t cure, so help him channel his impulsiveness into something positive, because believe me, as an ADHD riddled teen, idle hands **are** the devil’s playthings.Did you ever try switching to another medication? My doctor started me on concerta but when it was doing nothing for me she switched me over to Vyvanse and it's a hell of a lot more effective. That said if you're doing fine without the meds then no point in messing up your brain chemistry with something new!This makes no sense because you're literally passed the point of your body being able to absorb and process that..... OK--sorry for the following essay, but:

That is pure insanity. I just looked up and found that the maximum dose is 72mg. So when considering that, along with knowing how fucking strong that would feel (I guess if you've ever had Concerta work for you in the lower doses), 200mg becomes even more unfathomable. 

Even in the clinical trial, they only ever went up to 108mg for a patient. What's really fucked is that in pharmacology, it's known that the maximum dose of a drug means something and is decided based on very specific reasons related mainly to something called the *therapeutic index*. Exceeding the maximum dose means you've crossed the threshold where the therapeutic benefit is now outweighed by toxicity and increased severity of unintended bodily reactions (side effects). 

Generally there is *some* wiggle room that allows the maximum dose to be exceeded, but this is uncommon and certainly almost never is in the order of triple. You just don't do that, except for in the most dire, anomalous situations. 

Did he experiment with other drugs on you before testing out this example of disgusting malpractice? Did he even mention therapies or other forms of treatment? 1) Your doctor is an idiot, I hope you aren't seeing him anymore and reported him

2) Don't write off meds entirely. I did at one point, and thought my quality of life was fine. Turns out when I finally went back on a new med that agreed with me, there was a noticeable difference. Ritalin, Concerta, Dexedrine, there are a ton of different meds where most won't do shit for you, and which ones that is differs for everybody

Edit: I know you said Concerta, these are just the ones I've tried til settling on Dexedrine. There's a bunch of others as well, I just can't recall them at the momentA fifth of a gram, that's a recreational dose!As someone that has ADHD and has gotten therapy/medication for it as an adult, the way it's approached now does seem different than how I always hear it talked about being dealt with when I was a kid in the 90's, where doctors would seemingly just throw any child with a bit of hyperactivity onto ritalin and assume it was fixed.

The people I dealt with for therapy were *very* focused on treating my ADHD symptoms as much as possible without any medication at all, but understood that having medication can be beneficial for that process. I take a low dose of adderall now on a mostly daily basis, but what was most beneficial for me from the therapy was having a therapist or psych work with me to understand how I was processing things, where my issues were, and what I needed to do to combat them. A majority of my time was spent on establishing routines, building up good mental practices, and creating consistency in my daily life - I had medication during that time too, but one of the biggest things they stressed to me was that medications can only do so much, and it was up to me to really drill these things into my brain and really understand myself and how I processed things so I could function with or (ideally) without medication.

It was actually really useful and I echo what was said farther up in the comments - having a mental health doctor or therapist is something that everyone should be able to experience. It can be really beneficial to just have a third person, with no real connections to anyone else in your life (or even yourself), that you can talk to without worrying about what they'll think of you or that they'll be judging you for any other purpose than to help. [deleted]not a troll.I'm not saying you should go back to the mess that made you a vegetable, but that you should keep trying different cocktails and dosis. What would have happened if more than one tragedies were to happen?

That's what I'm saying, life sometimes a bicho and it might it you hard and fats unexpectedly, and you might not have time to react. 

Obviously I won't say go back to old meds just in case, it's true it's not worth it. But rather I say keep looking, you might find some that work for you like many others in this thread The physical world is often representative of the abstract world, but Schizophrenia is the abstract world pushing into consciousness so that the lines are blurred between metaphor and reality. Symbolic meaning becomes literal and abstract associations become the things themselves.

There is no science for an individuals reality, and no method or intervention that could group that for an individual successfully, especially not in a western point and shoot approach.

Of course, a psychiatrist may understand all of this very well (as well as what they know from training) but regardless of all the trips to Africa to help poor brown people, there are a lot of things that doctors can't learn in training, and this is almost the main one. 

Understanding this properly is almost antithetical to western science, you have to firstly be a lover of truth, secondly be completely fearless and lastly have a large capacity for adventure and have had a lot of life experience. If you have faith in science to the degree that people do here, you will never, ever be able to peer behind the veil.  

What I'm talking about is not supernatural, not spiritual or whatever. There is nothing supernatural that exists, but our minds are setup in a way that defies explanation through language.  

Every supernatural belief is real at an abstract level, and not all 'true' beliefs are real at physical level. The non-real things can be more real than the real.

The entire humanities departments are playing around with this shit - unknowingly. Boys can be girls, there is a systematic conspiracy against women, minorities are special and protected. This is proper crazy shit. They are modern shamans, using symbolism and playing with it to reinvent and reimagine things that can permanently change the psyche.    It's so hard to understand the level of where this operates but they are even using the precious 'science' to prove this crazy shit. Considering that - work out where the hierarchy of 'what is reality' for the mob really lies. Well, that's the rub. She takes her meds, she is very responsible, she serves her time, and yet it is because of her disorder and the meds not working that cause the problems. 

I am very torn by this because it is not her fault and she is doing everything possible.That is, objectively a better thing to be known for ;-)Impactful? not in the slightest. But like you said I no longer think I'm able to stop these little ticks and I'm young enough to worry about how they develop.

Sidenote, wtf is it about doing things in three that so many people seem to enjoy? I'll say 'now now now' in my head when I'm in an uncomfortable situation. Never four times, never twice.My primary care didn’t, he actually just gave me 14count 0.25mg pills and told me he wasn’t giving me anymore. But he also knew everything I had been through. I took them as directed, never abused them. And 1 week later I called him and told him I just needed a refill so I could get back on my feet at work. He was hesitant. But he did it. I had been going to him since elementary school.

The first day I took a klonopin, I feel in love with it. It was the first time I had felt “normal” in years. After the refill he gave me I ended up finding a pill mill and went there. They didnt hesitate to put me on a higher dosage (2mg twice a day)

I had no idea the rabbit hole I was headed in to. 7 years later I couldn’t recall hardly anything from the past 7 years. I was older, but I wasn’t wiser. I had time travelled 7 years into the future, but mentally I remained that same scared kid who was trying to cope with his mothers passing. Unfortunately the grieving  process was compounded by everything that had happened in those 7 years that I was always too numb to deal with.I'll ask if I ever manage to get into the neuropsychology unit here for testing. Getting the referral is easy, but the place I'm trying to get into keeps changing the requirements every time I clear up a previous hurdle. So we'll see. Hopefully the referral works. I'm on Medicaid so my options on who will take me are extremely limited. Thank you for that input! That makes a lot of sense. Well yes, but we dont even know whats up with our ocean. I mean we can see a lot, but we just dont know and dont understand a lot either.I dont disagree with science finding out how and what, its amazing to see how everything is made and what it is.

Im not against science, but i dont believe that it is the answer to everything.And thats totally fine. :)

I hope you might get to know god some day, but thats my hope and you can do with that whatever you want. :)What you call a flaw might just be something you dont understand, no offense.No its not. You assume that god had to be created too, but he just *is* he always was and will always be and even thats out of the concept. That god had to be created is a concept of time, but god created time and is not affected be it. He just is.

The answer to "Why does god exist" is the wrong question, a question which cannot be answered.

I like this guys answer, too, though: https://www.wordonfire.org/resources/blog/why-does-god-exist/4674/We got lots of simple minds need easing over here. Lol. The bible does not do a poor job explaining the why, you can say a lot about the bible, but saying its answer is poor is not fair if you dont know what it says.

The website is still a work in progress so I'm not sharing it yet.There's obviously a big difference between *ideal* care and *basic* care. Yes, having someone who would be able to help me through each different, distinct state would require me to essentially teach a class on my symptoms. That's a long-term goal that I am working towards.

What *shouldn't* be out of my reach at *any* time is basic care, respect, and emotional support. When looking for help during a schizophrenic episode, I have had people...

- Start crying because they were scared of me
- Get angry and threaten to call the police because I could not tell them what was wrong
- Actually call the police on me because they didn't feel like dealing with it
- Tell me that I was just making it up for attention and I needed to stop
- Stop responding to my messages and/or block me
- Get up and physically leave the apartment out of frustration, saying 'Text me when you're normal'
- Repeatedly shout 'I don't know what to do! I don't know how to help!' instead of saying literally anything else
- Sexually assault me
- Physically hurt me


You don't need a degree in psychology to know that if someone is struggling, the least you can do is not actively hurt them. I'm not jaded; I'm pragmatic. At this point, based on my past experience, the illogical thing would be to continue reaching out for help when nearly everyone I have ever asked turned it into a more painful, long-lasting situation than the original episode.

As I said before, when I'm sick, my priority needs to be me, not someone else's fear, frustration, anger, or sense of inadequacy.I'm glad I could helpTotally hear you on that. I agree it would be prudent to get checked to casually keep a medical eye on it, but my point was that it's not technically a disorder requiring treatment if it isn't causing impairment or distress. I fully support seeking help early.The however was supposed to cover the agreement that you shouldn't ignore it. Sorry for the miscommunication I guess.I was actually going to point out that my dog helps me tremendously! She calms me and is able to ease my worries. I'm glad you are working on things as well!

And no, thankfully i didn't give him the chance to palm me off with something else. It's weird too, because the doctor that gave me the diagnosis changed and this guy is the replacement i got. I'm pretty sure he got more money the more drugs i took.Oh no, i actually got quite vocal with him and i just never turned up to an appointment.

Me too!"Keep trying different cocktails and doses" = trying a ton of crap with a ton of side effects with a ton of juggling. You're told to try at least 4 weeks for the medicine to build up in your system to see an "relief" and no relief could mean higher dose (more side effects yay!) OR try a new med. But wait...it gets better. Because it's so dangerous to stop meds like this cold turkey I get to be weaned off bit by bit. Meanwhile still got those side effects which oh yeah could be *permanent*. But let's keep trying! Time for a new med while detoxing, let's start the cycle all over again. 

No. Absolutely not. 

"What would you do if a ton of tragedies happened back to back?" I've said this multiple times, and this is the last time I will say it: If in the event I'm extremely symptomatic I have no problems using meds. That event ain't today, and no offense man nothing you say will change my mind. The mental health industry has a long way to go, and I don't see anything changing anytime soon. I hope my reply doesn't come off as antagonistic, but I want to address some of the claims you've made.

> The physical world is often representative of the abstract world, but Schizophrenia is the abstract world pushing into consciousness so that the lines are blurred between metaphor and reality. Symbolic meaning becomes literal and abstract associations become the things themselves.

This statement gives me the impression that you are confused about what schizophrenia is. What do you mean by "abstract world?" Do you mean cognitive concepts like language and symbols? Then you have it backwards - the abstract world is representative of the physical world, not the other way around. And what does that have to do with schizophrenia? Yes, its many symptoms include delusion and hallucinations, but to boil it down to the "abstract world pushing into consciousness so that the lines are blurred between metaphor and reality" is neither accurate nor helpful for understanding the disease, and is an over-simplification at the very least, if not downright confusing. [The causes for schizophrenia are neurological in nature and it involves a wide range of symptoms.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia)

> There is no science for an individuals reality, and no method or intervention that could group that for an individual successfully, especially not in a western point and shoot approach.

While it's true that each person's subjective experience can only be described in the first person, the nature of consciousness is far from impenetrable by science. We know that the mind **is** what the brain **does**, and that alterations to the brain physically or chemically cause changes in the conscious process. By combining first-person patient reporting with empirical data such as MRI scans, we can shed light on conscious and unconscious mental phenomenon, though there is still much to be learned.

> but regardless of all the trips to Africa to help poor brown people

...what?

> there are a lot of things that doctors can't learn in training, and this is almost the main one.

But that's precisely what psychiatric training is for - understanding, treating, and preventing mental disorders.

> Understanding this properly is almost antithetical to western science, you have to firstly be a lover of truth

Science is **precisely** the pursuit of truth. I'm sorry if something or someone has given you the impression otherwise. Science is also by no means an endeavor limited to the west.

> If you have faith in science to the degree that people do here, you will never, ever be able to peer behind the veil.

I appreciate your enthusiasm for "open-mindedness." Sometimes new discoveries can be surprising and unanticipated, and require creative thinking. However, an open mind must be guarded by a healthy level of skepticism and a rigorous, methodical approach - otherwise all you are doing is just uncritically letting in any nonsense that strikes your fancy.

> Every supernatural belief is real at an abstract level, and not all 'true' beliefs are real at physical level. The non-real things can be more real than the real.

Belief is a powerful thing. And the mind can also deceive us very easily. A hallucination might be "real" for the person experiencing it, but it's not real for anyone else - that's how we know it's not real in the empirical sense. The question is, how do we make sure our beliefs about reality are true? The answer is scientific testing. We devise a model (theory) that predicts how reality is supposed to work, then we experiment, and the model is updated according to the results of the experiment. The more accurate your theory is in predicting the outcomes of various experiments, the more we can trust that it accurately describes reality. We never get to absolute 100% Truth with a capital T, but we can get closer and closer by continually refining our models. This is the only method to understand diseases like schizophrenia, which is no easy task.

> The entire humanities departments are playing around with this shit - unknowingly. Boys can be girls, there is a systematic conspiracy against women, minorities are special and protected. This is proper crazy shit.

I guess you're trying to say that the humanities actively confront and challenge social constructions like gender roles and race? I don't disagree but I also don't see how that's relevant to schizophrenia.

> They are modern shamans, using symbolism and playing with it to reinvent and reimagine things that can permanently change the psyche.

The phenomenon you are describing is "culture." If all "shamans" do is change culture, why call them shamans? Literally everyone changes culture by being a part of it.

> It's so hard to understand the level of where this operates but they are even using the precious 'science' to prove this crazy shit.

The "precious science" that studies culture includes anthropology, sociology, and psychology. These are active fields of study that are by no means on the fringe. The context in which you refer to science gives me the impression that you find science distasteful. In fact, the social sciences are endless fascinating - I think you would probably really enjoy many avenues of research about culture, humanity, and the mind.

I urge you not to fall prey to anti-scientific, pseudo-mystical dogma. There is a lot of great research being done about schizophrenia, as well as the culture, the mind, and consciousness. I refer you to [VS Ramachandran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilayanur_S._Ramachandran) or [Oliver Sacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Sacks) for fascinating reads/YouTube lectures about the mind, with their focus of study being rare and bizarre mental disorders. I think in the end you'll get a lot more understanding and enjoyment from researchers like these than this alleged "shamanism," which just reeks of mystical nonsense to be perfectly frank. Again I hope I'm not coming off as antagonistic or arrogant - you seem genuinely interested in the subject but ultimately misguided, and when you say things like "take the boy to a shaman" you are giving the exact *opposite* of helpful advice to someone with a potentially schizophrenic child.Hopefully she gets an Not Criminally Responsible ruling (at least I think that's what it's called here in Canada). Not sure how exactly that is determined, and if there are still consequences, but that's what I meant but hoping they take her illness into account with the legal result. Even if she's doing everything she can, if there comes a point where she is a risk to herself and others, she needs to be placed on a psychiatric hold until she has recovered.

Luckily they went into detail in that link and all i could surmise from further reading is that god is really fond of himself. So fond of himself that he created smaller/lesser versions of himself to talk to and astonish and judge.  



If thats the why, I'm underwhelmed. And i cant possibly imagine anything worth worship that would set my soul on fire for eternity because I dont buy that.Hmm, I wouldn't call that prideful, just a personal experience that was real to you. It doesn't make it *true,* simply that you were convinced by it. My point being that even the things *closest* to us are pretty far away. If the universe is not empty, what exactly are you saying it's full of?

Yes, there are planets/stars/galaxies etc. but those are very far from everything else as well. And so far, no indication of life as we know it, definitely not human-like life.Ohhh, my apologies.

If you Snap you may won't recognize that it happened

Like, seriously, go look at testimonies of people that had your mentality and had bad luck. Yo, this is a good reply, and I appreciate it.

It might not be possible for me to explain what I'm saying.  I have been ruthlessly scientific my entire life. I am obsessively against hypocrisy within myself and objective in my systems of thought. That is, I create and test systems of thought where none of the outputs of a way of thinking change the world in a way that invalidates the premises/assumptions.

You can only take my word for that, of course, but as a 7 year old I bailed on the family religion for lack of logical, systematic consistency.

This kind of thing is hard to describe accurately, easy to get wrong if not 100% sharp, plenty is lost in context, in language and in writing.

So I would say that the abstract world is projected onto the physical world for most people as much as the other way around.  Most people are incapable of science without the methodology of science - because their minds are irretrievably biased towards their politics, their morality, their sense of self, e.t.c.  This is especially prevalent in anthropology, sociology and psychology. Your definition of schizophrenia as a problem to be solved is a problem.  Is Usain Bolts deviance from the norm a problem, or do we celebrate his un-natural athleticism because it wins races?  I could argue that our society and its expectations are more un-natural than an ape with neurological divergence from a hypothetical ideal.

Science is used today to validate biases, and in the humanities they do not even pretend that they are trying to do any different with their understanding of, and acceptance of (neo-marxist) post-modernism.  If you love science, you must have deep concerns with these things.

For most people science is sacred. This is because it gets results, and it should be sacred, for most people.  But in many subjects, we are already operating at the fringes of where science is useful, including maths, physics e.t.c. It takes special individuals (who would operate outside of the scientific methodology anyway) to make major discoveries today, and raw intelligence has little bearing on whether people are susceptible to these biases.

Because we have so many incredibly intelligent people around who have these irretrievably deep biases, there is a space for post-modern ideas in the philosophy of science. The fringes of most of science have been explored. The methodology has limits, and those specific limits are - biases of morality, the abstract concept of self, superstition/magic, personal politics (linked to the sense of self) as well as conceptual structures that a person relies on to support these things.  

Overcoming these biases is completely unnecessary in western society today to survive, and the Scientific method has been co-opted at embedding these biases into the humanities through intellectualisation of the bias.  These people are incredibly intelligent, but their ego wants it, and post-modernism allows it.  Because there are so many people who are in this basket - the majority, and because they need careers and personal satisfaction, they simply do not question each other when they are full of shit.  How can you possibly explain gender theory with science? it exists in defiance of biology.

As for shamans - there are mental processes that things like NLP, hypnosis, mental association, psycho-therapy e.t.c. attempt to discover and thrash out, finding the symbols for the abstract internal concepts, and attempting to think about them in a way that relieves neuroticism.  This is precisely what shamans understand, for their own culture.  If you have ever read or heard a story about an indigenous culture that seems like a pretty shit story - that is because the abstract meaning that the characters or animals have is not understood outside of that culture/environment, or whatever.

Post-modernists do the exact same process to validate their politics, moral biases, self-concept e.t.c. They find accessible cultural symbols and insist on a simultaneous acceptance of the physical and abstract meaning of the symbols, powered by highly intellectual minds to get particular results. They intellectualise these rituals with the scientific method.  Quite a flaw in the method when you can do this.

Now I am sure that you know most of this, and I know that I have probably come off as anti-scientific or even mystical.  That really isn't what I'm about at all.  I know that magic doesnt exist, but I don't think that you are appreciating that some things cannot be taught, some personal obstacles cannot be overcome in a school, university or lab, and western civilisation at this point is particularly bad at piercing the veil.

To put it another way, love is as real as God and a proper shamans would understand psychology on a level that is superior to many psychologists that needed a job when they finished school.

Edit: I repeat myself a little re: post-modernism and how it protects academics and their careersOh I feel you on that. I lost my father at 15, then my mother at 20.

I had a son this year. My first. Not a single person from my side of the family has even met him. He’s 5 months old now.

And a pill mill is essentially a place where a “doctor” has license to prescribe, but their interest in is your money not you as a person. You literally go and tell them what you want/what your on. And within 25 minutes you’re walking out with a prescription.

EDIT
I wasn’t aware of what a pill mill was or that I was actually at one until after the fact.The question isn’t who is going to let me; it’s who is going to stop me.Yeah if you dont know god its hard to buy that, because thats what i would think myself if i were in your shoes.I can kind of agree with that, except that far is relative. I think I see what you're saying though.No worries, thanks for letting me clarify. I'm sorry to hear you didn't catch yours earlier, I hope it becomes easier for future sufferers to identify it and seek help early.Oh, thanks! I'll check it outGo read just as many stories of everyday people snapping under pressure. Of course one could argue they were ill to begin with right? And on and on we'll go. With the Vegas shooting, the church shooting, and now the most recent shooting everyone is on edge and once again the light is shone on mentally ill people. (Nothing will be done on the mental health or gun control issue of course), and I get your concern but for me you're barking up the wrong tree. And nothing you say will change that. Holy shit. The really fucked up part is that drug companies totally know about this and support it. Dont get me wrong, I was raised catholic. I accepted jesus into my heart at bible camp when i was 10. Singled out and encircled by camp directors and counsellors i had a religious experience. But it never stuck. The church never gave any answers. Not just meaning of life type answers. I mean basic questions.


If god is all powerful why doesnt he stop or destroy the devil? Why did god make us one way and give us rules to go against our nature? Why is failure punished by eternal damnation? How is that demonstrative of gods love? If god is all knowing does he know the future?  If he knows the future why should he bother running this weird experiment? Why would he create the devil?  Why was it ok to sell your daughters or substitute them for angels in gang rape? Why did god play such a cruel game with abraham and issac? Wouldnt god have known abrahams heart and his mind without being so horrific? 


I could never get an answer. Not from counsellors, pastures, not even a bishop that spoke to our school. Nothing but mysterious ways, have faith. Grandiose statements like his light will guide the way and his wisdom will guide your heart... blah blah.


I came up with an answer I could live with on my own.  Try to be a good person.  Not under threat of eternal hellfire but because my own reasoning tells me that its what we should do. And if im way off base here and there is an abrahamic god and that's not good enough for him, well then heavens not good enough for me.Earth isn't all that special when you consider the odds of one planet out of trillions having the right chemistry and conditions for life. It's just statistics.

If dinosaurs had abstract thought, they'd be praying to a dinosaur god. Maybe there was life on mars and they worshipped a martian-like god, until conditions changed? 

Why would a god want to create this one pale blue dot, and that's *it*? Or maybe there are humans all over the place? [Here's](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/science/space/keplers-tally-of-planets.html) another fascinating reference.Yah but there is nothing I can't do about shootings when I'm not even on the states lol. I'm for strict gun control and public Healthcare that includes mental health but nothing I can do about that so no Im not barking at the wrong tree just because there are bigger trees to bark

Normal people can snap, that's why no one shod have semi automat rifles,  mentally ill people can snap much more easily, that's why I think they should hear their doctors specially if they agree 

You do you, but not trying is not the correct thing to do even when trying IS really hard. Even though i dont agree with you, i can understand and i like that you at least made a decision instead of being on the fence.

Im sorry, im sorry that you trusted in people and they were not competent enough to answer your questions and instead gave you religious talk.

I dont have much time now as i am at work, but i will give you some answers:

> If god is all powerful why doesnt he stop or destroy the devil?

God did destroy the *power* of the devil already with the cross, beating him with his own weapons and own actions as the devils plan was to kill christ and exactly that brought redemption to humanity and set us free from the dominion of the devil. In the end he will destroy the devil completely:

http://biblehub.com/revelation/20-10.htm
http://biblehub.com/1_john/3-8.htm

> Why did god make us one way and give us rules to go against our nature? Why is failure punished by eternal damnation?

Those two questions result in the same question:

Why do we have free will and why does he punish it?

I dont know a verse answering that question completely on its own, but i have been teached, that this is because god wants real love and a love relationship with his people, but you cant have love if you force someone to love you. If you make a lovedrink and give it to someone, does that person actually love you? I would say no.
If god now wants love, he has to create us with the ability to decide if we want god or not and if you dont want god, then he doesnt want you and as he is the source of eternal life (eternal life is nothing that is outside of him), he has to put you to eternal death, aka hell. Also this guy has some other answer, that kinda makes sense, too: 
https://christianity.stackexchange.com/questions/16565/why-does-god-punish-us-when-he-gives-us-free-will
I have to say that god sounds more mad though, i like that answer but i cannot support it with the bible completely, as the bible clearly states his anger and hatred of sin, so it doesnt look like its just a consequence, but rather a punishment. Thats as much answer i can give you for this, as you see im trying to be as honest as possible, i dont want to lure someone in, i want to answer your questions not like those people did.

> How is that demonstrative of gods love?

God has many facettes, many traits, he is all loving and hopeful, nice and friendly. He also is powerful, mighty and holy and he also is judge. The punishment for sin is a demontration of being a judge. Important to note here is, that he does not want to judge us, its just what he has to do as a natural outcome of giving us free will. He did as much as he could with sending his beloved son to die for our sins on the cross and him taking that judgement for us. Its now our part to just take it as ours and living by it. Its a gift, a gift which sadly many people just dont want.

 > If god is all knowing does he know the future?
Short answer: Yes. Long answer: https://www.gotquestions.org/God-know-future.html

>  If he knows the future why should he bother running this weird experiment?

I think a lot is said already, its basically giving us a chance demonstrating what he knows already. How could ge save ones and judge others if stuff never happened but he just knows it would have happened? That would be my simple answer, maybe there is more to it.

> Why would he create the devil?

the devil was the most beautiful angel that ever was, he was even so beautiful, that he thought he is greater than god, thats why he started a war in heaven and ultimately lost and was thrown out of heaven with 1/3 of all angels. He created the devil to create a beautiful angel, but the devil decided he wanted to be more than that. In the end the devil will have his judgement for his actions.
The devil is a big part in his plan, in the end, the salvation of humanity which was needed because of the devil tricking us into eating the fruit, will lead to his ultimate goal of endless praise and endless love and joy for every person that entered into salvation. 
God used the devils bad for his own good, he basically tricked the devil.

> Why was it ok to sell your daughters or substitute them for angels in gang rape? 

Oh boy, toughest question i know and one i really have struggle answering for myself, let alone for others. Here is a thread about it: https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20091123102647AAGVAbF i cant give you no better answer. God says he will help those who suffer and will those who do bad, so in the end he will judge those people for doing what they did and will give back to those girls what has been taken from them. Here might be an answer, too: https://www.gotquestions.org/suffering-death.html

> Why did god play such a cruel game with abraham and issac?

He demonstrated to the entire world what god will actually do for humanity with jesus and he also tested abraham, if he really trusts in god. God told abraham that he will have a great offspring, still he told him to kill his only child which could bring such offspring. It was a test, maybe a cruel one, but we still read about it today and its a picture for jesus. I bet neither abraham nor isaac mind today, that he did that.

> Wouldnt god have known abrahams heart and his mind without being so horrific? 

Yes, but maybe this was also to teach abraham or isaac something and maybe this was something to teach every generation after him. It probably was very important that it happened, otherwise he wouldnt have dont this.

So now i actually gave you a long answer, whoops :D

I hope your question were answered to a degree that you can live with that. I think it is way better to read the bible and asking god to show you what he thought and thinks about different stuff in it instead of asking people why, because you can then be sure to have an answer, an answer which noone has told you, but either one you have found yourself. Its amazing what the bible can teach us about god and to the question of why. 

Im also just human with flaws and im not allknowing, i might have answered some questions wrong, i dont know. Thats why it is important to stay humble and keep learning.

I wish you all the best.I personally don't believe any god has concerns for us, and that's assuming there is one based on the the principle that something doesn't come from nothing. However as a philosopher I am open to being wrong about anything and everything.I do rather enjoy imagining dinosaurs being intelligent, but according to science iirc they had fairly small brains being related to the avian species.Please do not infer that my decision to not use medicine means I'm not trying. Trying meds is easy, living without them is hard. But I try everyday. And I live everyday. Go on a bender 6 months straight and tell me which was easier. You cannot see the world in black and white, there's a whole lot of grey out there as well. You'll see as you get older. Well wishes to you!Whence a god then? Oh well he just always *was.* 

Well, why can't the universe have "just always been"? That might be the case. Time and physics as we understand them, aren't necessarily the rule everywhere in the universe. That implies no big bang though, the way I see it, maybe the center of the universe might as well be god even if it isn't a being.Which is the Spinozan view, and what Einstein believed- his references to "god" were directed at the constant law of physics that apparently governs the universe.

But even *that* breaks down with black holes, where general relativity ends and quantum physics begins (from my basic understanding.) Einstein's formulas predicted black holes, and he understood that the math was correct, but he still didn't believe in them, oddly enough! His math would start to fall apart as he tried to explain them.

Anyway. Science has come within trillionths of a second of Planck time, aka the Big Bang and time as we know it. I find this *fascinating.* Love reading astrophysics books even if I don't understand all of it.Yeah I read more philosophy, but I'm a grad so I know a little science. Who knows maybe a black hole is a tear into another dimension.They're definitely fascinating. Just a shame that we wouldn't be able to explore other universes after the spaghettification process!
